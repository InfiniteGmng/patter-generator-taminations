# Split Square Thru

Timing: 6-8-10, SS 8-10-12

From a Static Square, or T-Bone. (From a Static Square, those designated step forward,
to form two side-by-side T-bones.): Those facing Right [Pull By](../b1/pull_by.md), 
[Quarter In](quarter_in.md) (to face those who didn't pull by), 
and all [Left Square Thru 3/4](../b1/square_thru.md).

Can also be done fractionally, or for a given number of hands. In these cases, the
fraction applies to those who start the call, e.g., for a Split Square Thru 3/4, the
dancers who start facing do a total of 3 Pull Bys, and the other two dancers do 2 Pull
Bys.
