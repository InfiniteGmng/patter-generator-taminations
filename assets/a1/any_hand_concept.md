# Any Hand Concept

This concept is used with calls that start with the right hand 
and are defined as a series of turns (e.g.,
[Swing Thru](../b2/swing_thru.md),
[1/4 Thru](quarter_thru.md),
[Remake](../a2/remake.md)).

Starting formation: Inverted Line or Inverted Box;
**every pair** of dancers must be in a right or lefthand
mini-wave.

Dance action: Dancers start by having everyone in a mini-wave (pair) 
turn by either the right or left
hand the appropriate amount. 
The call continues, with the following modifications as necessary:

- Turn 1/4 – if in a couple, use Cast Off 1/4
- Turn 1/2 – if in a couple, use Partner Trade
- Turn 3/4 – if in a couple, use Cast Off 3/4

For example, after a Heads Square Thru 4, Centers In, 
the call Any Hand Swing Thru would have all
dancers turn half (some by the right and some by the left)
and the new centers Partner Trade to end
in Facing Lines.

The [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md)
does not apply with this concept.
