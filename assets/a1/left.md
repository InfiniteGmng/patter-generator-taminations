# Left

The modifier "Left" applies to calls and interchanges right with left and, if also applicable, belle
with beau (and also clockwise and counterclockwise). Left should only be used to modify calls where
a right hand turn or shoulder pass is clearly part of the definition. The Left modifier is usually used
with calls that start with one of the following:
 
1. Right Pull By (e.g. Left Square Chain Thru, Left Split Square Thru) 
2. Pass Thru or passing action (e.g. Left Dosado, Left Pass and Roll, Left Track II, Left Wheel and Deal from a One-Faced Line) 
3. Tag The Line (e.g. Left 3/4 Tag, Left Turn and Deal) 
4. Right Arm Turn (e.g. Left Swing Thru, Left Turn Thru) 
5. Turn [a fraction] by the Right (e.g. Left 1/4 Thru, Left Remake)
6. Touch (e.g. Left Touch 1/4, Left Spin the Windmill) 
7. Turn to the right (e.g., Left Wheel Thru, Left Roll to a Wave, Left Chase)

To apply the [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) to a "Left" call, dancers first Step To A Left-Hand Wave (e.g., Left
Swing Thru, Left Relay the Deucey, Left 3/4 Top).

If a different modifier can perform the same function as the Left modifier (e.g., Wrong Way
Promenade, Reverse Flutterwheel), then Left should not be used. Also see "Reverse", below.

The Left modifier does not affect other directions that are explicitly given. E.g., in Left Spin the
Windmill Right, the outsides go right. (The Left only applies to the centers; this use of Left is only
necessary for Facing Couples.)

At Advanced, the left versions of the calls are part of the program even when they are not explicitly
listed.
