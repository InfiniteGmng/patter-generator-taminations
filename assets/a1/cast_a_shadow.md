# Cast a Shadow

Timing: 10

From the following formations only:
- 2x4 with the ends forming a tandem
- Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade

From a 2x4 formation with the ends forming a tandem: ends 1/2
[Zoom](../b2/zoom.md), [Arm Turn](../ms/turn_thru.md) 3/4,
and [Spread](../plus/anything_and_spread.md),
to become ends of a 2x4. Meanwhile centers
facing out [Cloverleaf](../ms/cloverleaf.md) and centers facing in
[Extend](../plus/extend.md), Arm Turn 1/4,
and Extend. The centers finish as centers of a 2x4 by stepping in between ends who spread
apart.  In the case in which all the centers are facing in, 
they [Pass In](pass_in.md) and [Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md); 
if all centers are facing out, they Cloverleaf.

From Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade: The caller must designate two couples, 
e.g., Heads Cast a Shadow.
Everyone acts as though the formation were Two-Faced Lines, with the designated couples as
the leads. Thus, the outsides do a Â½ Zoom
(with the designated outside acting as the lead), Arm Turn 3/4, and Spread, while the
designated centers [Cloverleaf](../ms/cloverleaf.md),
and the other centers Arm Turn 1/4 and Extend. Ends in Parallel Waves.

Note: Cast a Shadow is not proper from Columns because 
the ends are not in tandem with each other.
