# Cycle and Wheel

Timing: 4

From a 3-and-1 line: The dancers in the mini-wave do a [Recycle](../ms/recycle.md) 
while the couple does a [Wheel And Deal](../b2/wheel_and_deal.md). 
If the ends of the line are facing opposite directions, this will end in
couples facing. If the ends are both facing the same direction, the right end must pass in
front, to end in tandem couples.
