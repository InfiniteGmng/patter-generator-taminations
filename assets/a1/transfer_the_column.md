# Transfer the Column

From columns: The #1 and #2 dancers [Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) 3 spots,
working slightly wider than usual to give the centers room,
and Face In (to become a Couple).
Meanwhile, the #3 and #4 dancers [Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) and Arm Turn 3/4.
From the momentary right-hand or left-hand 1/4 Tag,
all [Extend](../plus/extend.md) to form parallel waves.
