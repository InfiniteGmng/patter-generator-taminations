# Linear Cycle

(from waves only for the Plus Program) - Starting formation -
Parallel Ocean Waves or Four (4) Dancer Waves to be either right or left-handed.
(For programs other than Plus, allowable formations include any formation in which the
end and adjacent center can single or partner hinge. This is a three part call.) 
 
1. ***The ends and adjacent centers [hinge](../ms/hinge.md).***  
2. ***Those facing out [fold](../ms/fold.md) behind those facing in and all dancers will then move forward in a [Double Pass Thru](../b2/double_pass_thru.md) action.***
3. ***If the hinge is right-handed, [peel](../plus/peel_off.md) right; if the hinge is left-handed, peel left to end as facing couples.***  

From a right-hand hinge, all will pass right shoulders. From a left-hand hinge, all
will pass left shoulders. 

An added note just for information from beyond the Plus Program -- 
From any inverted lines or some three in one lines, 
the [passing rule](../b1/passing_rule.md) shall prevail. (Not applicable in the
Plus Program.) 

STYLING: Arms in  natural dance position. Similar to styling for individual components. Rejoin hands upon completion of move.
