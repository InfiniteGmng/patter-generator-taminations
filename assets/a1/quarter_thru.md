# Quarter Thru

From any appropriate 4-dancer formation
(e.g., right-hand box circulate, left-hand
facing diamonds):
{high:Part1}Those who can
[Cast Off 1/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md)
by the Right,{/high}
{high:Part2}then those who can
[Trade](../b2/trade.md) by the Left.{/high}

There must be dancers who can do each part--the call is not legal from
an Inverted Box.

If there are two side-by-side formations each of which can do the call,
dancers don't
move from one to the other.
From right-hand columns, for example, each of the two box
circulate formations does the call independently.
