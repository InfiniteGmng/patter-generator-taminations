# Quarter Thru / Three Quarter Thru

## Quarter Thru

Timing: 6

From any appropriate 4-dancer formation
(for example, Right-Hand Box Circulate, Left-Hand Facing Diamonds):
***Those who can Turn 1/4 by the Right,***
***then those who can Turn 1/2 by the Left.***

There must be dancers who can do each part. The call is not proper from
an Inverted Box.

If there are two side-by-side formations each of which can do the call,
dancers don't move from one to the other.
For example: from Right-Hand Columns, each of the two Box
Circulate formations does the call independently.
