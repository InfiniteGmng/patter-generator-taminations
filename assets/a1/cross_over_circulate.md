# Cross Over Circulate

From general lines only: Each dancer moves forward one spot along the circulate path
shown below: A lead end [ Circulates](../b1/circulate.md) 
to the far center spot in the same line; a lead center
[Circulates](../b1/circulate.md) to the far end spot in the same line; 
a trailing end [Circulates](../b1/circulate.md) to the near
center spot in the other line, and a trailing center 
[Circulates](../b1/circulate.md) to the near end spot in the other line. If
two dancers are about to collide and they are facing the same direction, the belle goes in
front of the beau; if they are facing each other, they pass right shoulders.

For Teaching: You can describe this as: 
Leads [ Cross Run](../b2/run.md) as trailers (do their part of)
[Couples Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) and [ Half Sashay](../b1/sashay.md) 
as they go. However, it is far more effective to
re-introduce the idea of circulate paths (already used at Basic), and use it to describe
the call.
