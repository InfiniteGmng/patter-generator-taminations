## Rotate / Reverse Rotate

### Rotate 1/4, 1/2, 3/4

From Parallel Lines, composed entirely of Couples (for example,
Facing Lines, Two-Faced Lines) only: Each Box of 4 of the
square works independently. As couples turn 1/4 toward
promenade direction (giving a Left-Hand Two-Faced Line).
That new line does a Couples Hinge once for each 1/4 in
the fraction the caller gives (caller must give a fraction).
