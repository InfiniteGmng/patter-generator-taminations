# Stack the Line

From tandem couples, box circulate, and some T-bone boxes (there are usually
2 leads and 2 trailers): All [1/4 In](../a1/quarter_in.md), and the original lead dancers
[Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) (on the diagonal, if necessary) 
to form a right-hand mini-wave with the others. The
original trailers slide sideways if necessary. Finishes in a right-hand
mini-wave, except for some T-bone boxes.
