# Here Comes the Judge

From a general line of four with both ends facing the same direction: Dancer
on the right end [Trades](../b2/trade.md) to the other end of the line. Meanwhile, each of the
other dancers, in a single, smooth motion, faces the vacated spot, takes a step
forward, and turns another 1/4 in the same direction as first turned. Finishes
in a line facing the opposite direction.
