# 3 by 1 Transfer The Column

From Columns: The first 3 dancers in each column do the Promenade part of 
[Transfer the Column](../a1/transfer_the_column.md), while the #4 dancer 
[Extend](../b2/extend.md) (to meet the other #4 dancer),
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md), and 
[Extend](../b2/extend.md). Finishes in 3-and-1 Lines. On the Extend, the lone
dancer steps to a Mini-Wave with the center of the outside threesome, using the
same hand used in the Cast.
