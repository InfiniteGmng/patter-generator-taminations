# Cross Invert the Column 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full

From columns: The #1 dancer in each column [Trail Off](../a2/trail_off.md) and walk forward,
followed by the other dancers in the column. Finishes back in columns close
together (requires an adjustment at the end). If the caller gives a fraction,
then one person does the [Trail Off](../a2/trail_off.md) for each 1/4 in the fraction, and the
resulting columns balance themselves so that they are mutually centered. Thus,
for Cross Invert the Column 3/4, the first 3 dancers in each column move across
and around the other column, finishing in an "H":
