# Crazy Concept / Reverse Crazy Concept

## Crazy Concept

From Parallel Lines or Waves, a Tidal Wave, etc.: This concept can apply to
1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-dancer calls only.
***Each half of the square does the call***,
***then centers only do the call***,
***then each half does the call***,
***then centers only do the call***.
For example: **Crazy Flutter Wheel**--From lines of
four facing: All [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), center four
[Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), 
all [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md),
center four [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), to end in Facing Lines.

Example: **Crazy Mix**--From a Tidal Wave: Each wave does a 
[Mix](../a1/mix.md), center wave does a
[Mix](../a1/mix.md),
each line does a [Mix](../a1/mix.md), center wave does a [Mix](../a1/mix.md). 

The Crazy Concept can be fractionalized into four parts.

Example: **1/2 Crazy Right and Left Thru**--From Facing Lines of four: Each side does a 
[Right and Left Thru](../b1/right_and_left_thru.md), center four do a 
[Right and Left Thru](../b1/right_and_left_thru.md).

## Reverse Crazy Concept

This works the same as the [Crazy Concept](crazy_concept.md) except ***the centers only do the call***,
then ***each half of the square does the call***, then ***centers only do the call***, then
***each half does the call***.
