# Crazy Concept

From parallel lines or waves, a tidal wave, etc.: This concept can apply to
1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-dancer calls only.
***Each half of the square does the call***,
***then centers only do the call***,
***then each half does the call***,
***then centers only do the call***.
For example: **Crazy Flutter Wheel**--From lines of
four facing: All [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), center four
[Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), 
all [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md),
center four [Flutter Wheel](../b2/flutterwheel.md), to end in lines of four facing. 
Example: **Crazy Mix**--From a tidal wave: Each wave does a 
[Mix](../a1/mix.md), center wave does a
[Mix](../a1/mix.md),
each line does a [Mix](../a1/mix.md), center wave does a [Mix](../a1/mix.md). 

The Crazy Concept can be fractionalized into four parts. 
Example: **1/2 Crazy Right and Left Thru**--From lines of four facing: Each side does a 
[Right and Left Thru](../b1/right_and_left_thru.md), center four do a 
[Right and Left Thru](../b1/right_and_left_thru.md).
