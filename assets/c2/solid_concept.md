# Solid Concept

From various formations: Solid is the same as "work as if they are a
single dancer." This means that the named formation works as a unit of one.
Everyone in the Solid unit must be facing the same direction. (For example:
From a Trailing Galaxy, "Tandem-Based Triangle, work Solid, all 
[Flip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md).")
