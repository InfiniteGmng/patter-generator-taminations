# Funny Square Thru

As many dancers as possible do each part of the call (each part
is a Pull By and [Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md) except for the last part,
which is a Pull By. For
example: in a box with 3 dancers facing the Side direction and 1 the Head
direction. Funny Square Thru would be "Those facing Pull By and Quarter In",
repeat twice more, then those facing Pull By again but do not Quarter In.:
