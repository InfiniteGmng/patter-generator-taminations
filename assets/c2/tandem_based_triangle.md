# Tandem-Based Triangle Calls

In a Tandem-Based Triangle, the Apex is the Trailer. Mentally add a phantom
in front of the apex to make a Box of Four. Now such calls as 
[Peel Off](../plus/peel_off.md), 
[Peel and Trail](../a2/peel_and_trail.md), 
and [Trail Off](../a2/trail_off.md) can be done treating the 
Tandem-Based Triangle as a Box of Four.
