# Fascinating (Anything)

From various formations: Ends [Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) 1-1/2, while the centers
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md)
and the very centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md). The end dancers of the center six, with the adjacent
dancer, do the Anything call concentrically, as the lonesome ends 
[Counter Rotate 1/4](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) to
become adjacent to the remaining centers. Ending position will vary according to
the Anything call.
