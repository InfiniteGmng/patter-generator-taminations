# Invert the Column / Cross Invert the Column

## Invert the Column (1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full)

From Columns: The #1 dancer in each column [Peel Off](../plus/peel_off.md) (away from the other
column) 180 degrees and walk forward as everyone else follows single file.
Finishes in Columns close together (requiring an adjustment at the end). If the
caller gives a fraction, the number of 1/4s in the fraction indicates the number
of dancers who do the Peel Off action, while the remaining dancers [Extend](../b2/extend.md) once
for each 1/4. The Columns balance themselves, so that they are mutually
centered. Thus, for Invert the Column 1/2: #1 does the Peel Off and #2 follows,
forming Parallel Waves with the #3 and #4 dancers, who move up one spot.

## Cross Invert the Column (1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full)

From Columns: The #1 dancer in each column [Trail Off](../a2/trail_off.md) and walk forward,
followed by the other dancers in the column. Finishes back in Columns close
together (requires an adjustment at the end). If the caller gives a fraction,
then one person does the [Trail Off](../a2/trail_off.md) for each 1/4 in the fraction, and the
resulting Columns balance themselves so that they are mutually centered. Thus,
for Cross Invert the Column 3/4, the first 3 dancers in each column move across
and around the other column, finishing in an "H":
