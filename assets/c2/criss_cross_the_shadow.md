# Criss Cross the Shadow

From Parallel Waves or Lines, with Ends in Tandem: 
Ends 1/2 [Zoom](../b2/zoom.md) but meet
with their original inside hands, [Cast 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md) and
[Spread](../plus/anything_and_spread.md); Centers Facing In Cross Extend, 
[Hinge](../ms/hinge.md) with each other, and 
[Extend](../b2/extend.md); Centers Facing Out
[Cloverleaf](../ms/cloverleaf.md) but
Cross to the other center. 
Centers remain Centers and Ends remain Ends. 

If all the Centers are Trailers, they [Pass Out](../a1/pass_in.md) in place of the
Cross-Extend-Hinge-Extend.
