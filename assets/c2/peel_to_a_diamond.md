# Peel / Trail to a Diamond

## Peel to a Diamond

Starting Formations: Box Circulate, Tandem Couples, or Tandem
Dancers in a Z (for example, after Ends Fold from a Wave, or after Step and
Slide from a Two-Faced Line)

Lead dancers do their part of a [Peel Off](../plus/peel_off.md).
Trailing dancers step
forward, if necessary, until shoulder-to-shoulder and then 
[Hinge](../ms/hinge.md) with each other.

The call is danced so the ending formation has the same center
point as the starting formation. Box Circulate or the given Z examples
end in a Facing Diamond. Tandem Couples end in a Funny Diamond.

Peel to a Diamond cannot be fractionalized. Everyone can
[Roll](../plus/anything_and_roll.md) after a Peel to a Diamond.
