# Right / Left Loop 1, 2, 3

From any appropriate formation: Each designated dancer does a 
Run around \<N> adjacent positions, in the direction specified, 
and ending a distance of \<N>+1 positions from their starting position. 
Unlike Run, any non-designated dancers do not move. Any positions passed
may be occupied or unoccupied.

As an example, on "Right Loop 3", 
the designated dancer moves to the right, passing 3
positions, and ending a distance of 4 positions from where they started.

Loop is frequently used to get dancers into or out of 
specific formations, such as
Parallelograms, Offset formations, or Blocks. For example:

>
> ![alt](loop_2a.png)
> ![alt](loop_2b.png)
>

If the direction is “In” or “Out”, it refers to the initial direction
of the motion toward or away from the center of the overall set.

Boys In Loop 2:

> ![alt](loop_3b.png)

The directions “In” or “Out” can only be used 
if no designated dancer is facing directly toward
or away from the center of the set.

If \<N> is zero, the dance action is the same as a Run
in the same direction (but, again, any
non-designated dancers do not move).

Everyone Left Loop 0:

The Same Position Rule does not apply; \<direction> Loop \<N> is not proper
if it would cause two dancers to occupy the same spot.
