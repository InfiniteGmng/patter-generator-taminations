# Right / Left Loop 1, 2, 3

From anywhere a [Run](../b2/run.md) is possible, or from a single dancer: The designated
dancer does a [Run](../b2/run.md) around the adjacent vacant spot or dancer, who does not
move! The caller must designate a looping direction (right, left, in,
out), and must say how many people or spots to pass. For example: in
Right Loop 3 the looper moves to the right, passing 3 positions.
