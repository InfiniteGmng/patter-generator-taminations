# Funny Concept

Funny is a "Those Who Can" concept. On each part of the call being done,
as many people as possible do that part, as long as no two people finish on the
same spot. Examples:

Funny [Box Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) 2:

## Funny Square Thru

As many dancers as possible do each part of the call (each part
is a Pull By and [Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md) except for the last part,
which is a Pull By). For
example: in a Box with 3 dancers facing the Side direction and 1 the Head
direction. Funny Square Thru would be "Those facing Pull By and Quarter In",
repeat twice more, then those facing Pull By again but do not Quarter In.
