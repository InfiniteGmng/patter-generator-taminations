# Zip Code 1-6

From any 2x4 formation with the centers in columns
(for example, Double Pass Thru or Eight Chain Thru):
***Centers [Quarter Out](../a1/quarter_in.md) (forming a momentary T-bone) and
[Run](../b2/run.md)
around the outsides [=Zip Code 1]***,
***[Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) [=Zip Code 2]***,
***[Ends Bend](../a1/ends_bend.md) [=Zip Code 3]***,
***[Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) [= Zip Code 4]***,
etc. As this happens, the original outsides move
into the center, without turning. Odd numbers give Facing Ends; even give
Back-to-Back Ends.
