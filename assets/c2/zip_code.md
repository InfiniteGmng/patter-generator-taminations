# Zip Code 1-6

From any 2x4 formation with the centers in columns
(e.g. double pass thru or eight chain thru):
{high:Part1}Centers [Quarter Out](../a1/quarter_out.md) (forming a momentary T-bone) and
[Run](../b2/run.md)
around the outsides [=Zip Code 1]{/high},
{high:Part2}[Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) [=Zip Code 2]{/high},
{high:Part3}[Ends Bend](../a1/ends_bend.md) [=Zip Code 3]{/high},
{high:Part4}[Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) [= Zip Code 4]{/high},
etc. As this happens, the original outsides move
into the center, without turning. Odd numbers give facing ends; even give
back-to-back ends.
