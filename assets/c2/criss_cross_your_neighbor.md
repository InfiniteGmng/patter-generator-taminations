# Criss Cross Your Neighbor

From a Box Circulate formation: Trailers Cross Extend, [Cast 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md) and
[Spread](../plus/anything_and_spread.md) (becoming
Ends of a new Wave), while Leaders, as one smooth motion, 
1/2 [Box Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) and
[Cross Run](../b2/run.md) (working outside the others) to become the Centers of a new
Wave.

## Chase Your Criss Cross Neighbor

From Back-to-Back Couples only: 
In one smooth motion, Belles U-Turn Back to the right
and all Box Circulate; Criss Cross Your Neighbor. 
Ends in a Left-Hand Wave. This call
feels like beginning a Chase Right and blending into a 
Criss Cross Your Neighbor.

## Pass and Roll Your Criss Cross Neighbor

From Single Eight Chain Thru: All Pass Thru. 
The Centers Turn Thru while the Putsides
do a right-face U-Turn Back. 
All begin a Pass Thru, blending smoothly into Criss Cross
Your Neighbor (equivalent to Pass Thru; 
Centers Left Touch 3/4 and Spread while
outsides 1/4 Right and Cross Run (to the far center position)). 
Ends in a Left-Hand Wave.

Note: There is no consensus on the parts of this call 
or on how many parts it has. It does
have a definite first part (All Pass Thru), so 
“Finish Pass and Roll Your Criss Cross Neighbor” is proper, 
but fractionalizing this call or referring to any part except the first
is not proper.
