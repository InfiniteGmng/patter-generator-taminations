# Alter and Circulate

From parallel waves:
***All Turn 1/2***.
***Centers [Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md)***
and ***the very centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md)***,
while ***the ends [U-Turn Back](../b1/turn_back.md)*** and
***[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) once***,
***turn the star 1/2 ([Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) each diamond 1/2)***,
and ***[Flip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md)***.
Finishes in waves. 

If directed, the star can turn other fractions (e.g. "Alter and
Circulate, turn the star 3/4"). Note that the star turning is done by 
[Counter Rotating](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) the diamond, not by 
[Diamond Circulates](../plus/diamond_circulate.md): No matter how far the
star turns, the same people flip in at the finish. Thus, "Alter and
Circulate, turn the star 3/4" would end in a tidal wave.
