# Alter and Circulate

From parallel waves:
{high:Part1}All Turn 1/2{/high}.
{high:Part2}Centers [Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md){/high}
and {high:Part3}the very centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md){/high},
while {high:Part2}the ends [U-Turn Back](../b1/turn_back.md){/high} and
{high:Part3}[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) once{/high},
{high:Part4}turn the star 1/2 ([Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) each diamond 1/2){/high},
and {high:Part5}[ lip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md){/high}.
Finishes in waves. 

If directed, the star can turn other fractions (e.g. "Alter and
Circulate, turn the star 3/4"). Note that the star turning is done by 
[Counter Rotating](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) the diamond, not by 
[Diamond Circulates](../plus/diamond_circulate.md): No matter how far the
star turns, the same people flip in at the finish. Thus, "Alter and
Circulate, turn the star 3/4" would end in a tidal wave.
