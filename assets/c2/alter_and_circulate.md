# Alter and Circulate

From Parallel Waves:
***All Turn 1/2***.
***Centers [Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md)***
and ***the Very Centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md)***,
while ***the Ends [U-Turn Back](../b1/turn_back.md)*** and
***[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) once***,
***turn the Star 1/2 ([Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) each Diamond 1/2)***,
and ***[Flip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md)***.
Finishes in Waves. 

If directed, the star can turn other fractions (for example, "Alter and
Circulate, turn the star 3/4"). Note that the Star turning is done by 
[Counter Rotating](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) the Diamond, not by 
[Diamond Circulates](../plus/diamond_circulate.md): No matter how far the
Star turns, the same people flip in at the finish. Thus, "Alter and
Circulate, turn the Star 3/4" would end in a Tidal Wave.
