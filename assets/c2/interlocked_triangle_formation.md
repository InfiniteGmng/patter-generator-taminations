# Interlocked Triangle Formation

These consist of two Triangles, whose center-most dancers are working with the furthest outside dancers in
a Triangle.

Examples of Interlocked Triangles:

Caution: Callers are cautioned that Interlocked Triangles were added to C-2 in 2010 and they have never
received much use even at C-3 or C-4. While the entire “family” was added and defined, some of its members
(e.g., Outside Interlocked Triangles) are very difficult to see and don’t necessarily dance well. Caller
judgment needs to be exercised.

**Inpoint/Inside/Outpoint/Outside Interlocked Triangles**  
Various formations, including Twin Diamonds and Point-to-Point Diamonds, contain Interlocked
Triangles.


**Inside Interlocked Triangles**  
The Center 6 form the Triangles.

Note: These triangles may be easier for the dancers to identify with the phrase “Ignore the center 2,
Interlocked Triangle …”.

**Inpoint Interlocked Triangles**  
Each point facing in is an apex.
