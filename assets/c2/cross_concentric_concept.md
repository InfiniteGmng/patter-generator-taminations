# Cross-Concentric Concept

From any appropriate formation (there must be a center 4): The center 4 do
the call in their group and move to the outside, while the outsides work with
each other and do the call as they move into the center. The following diagrams
show who works with whom on a Cross-Concentric call:

The last two formations shown are really the same; the grouping on the left is
used if the caller only says "Cross-Concentric..." or the
Cross-Concentric call doesn't start in diamonds. The grouping on the right is used
when the caller says "Cross-Concentric Diamond..." or when the
Cross-Concentric call can only be done from diamonds (e.g. Cross-Concentric
Diamond Circulate). 

If the Cross-Concentric call is being done from general lines or general
columns, and the call starts and ends in a 2x2 box (e.g. Cross-Concentric Star
Thru), the following rule applies: If the centers begin as though in columns,
they finish as though the ends of columns; if they begin in lines, they finish
as the ends of lines.

If the Cross-Concentric call ends in a 2x2 box but starts
elsewhere (e.g. Cross-Concentric [ Recycle](../ms/recycle.md) from a tidal wave), the following rule
applies: The new outside dancers (the original centers!) adjust so that the long
axis of the ending formation is at right angles to the long axis of the starting
formation.
