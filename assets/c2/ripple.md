# Designated Dancers Ripple 1, 2, 3

From a wave or tidal wave: Those designated will any-hand [Swing](../a2/swing.md) 1/2 toward
the center of the formation, the number of hands given, alternating hands. This
call can be fractionalized (e.g. Ripple 2-1/2). Designated dancers can do 
[Partner Trades](../b2/trade.md) instead of Swing 1/2s, if the starting formation is not a wave.
