# Triangle Formation

A triangle is a formation of 3 dancers. One is the apex and the other two form the base. If the base
dancers are aligned in a general column, the triangle is called a tandem-based triangle. If the base
dancers are aligned in a general line, the triangle is called a wave-based triangle. In some triangles all 3
dancers may not be immediately adjacent to each other. Triangles are found as parts of a galaxy,
hourglass, twin diamonds and various other formations.

**Triangle Circulate**
From a triangle: Each dancer moves forward one position
along one of the circulate paths shown below:

Teaching Hint: Every dancer has one shoulder toward the
inside of the triangle. After Triangle Circulate, that same
shoulder is still toward the center.

Note: On Triangle Circulate from a T-boned triangle (base dancers are T-boned to each other), base dancers
use their own starting position to determine whether to treat the triangle as tandem-based or wave-based,
whereas apex dancers use the starting position of the spot to which they Circulate.

**Inpoint/Inside/Outpoint/Outside Triangles**.
Various formations, including Twin Diamonds and Point-to-Point Diamonds, contain Triangles.

**Inside Triangle**: The Center 6 form the Triangles.

**Outside Triangle**: The Outside 6 form the Triangles.

The footprints of twin diamonds, with the outside 4 in tandem, contain additional Triangles. Each of
these triangles has one point as the apex and two of the center 4 as the base.

**Inpoint Triangle**:Each point facing in is an apex.

**Outpoint Triangle**: Each point facing out is an apex.

**Tandem-based/Wave-based Triangles**  
Various formations, especially a Galaxy, contain triangles that may be
identified by the formation of their “base”. A wave-based triangle has
the dancers in the base usually in a mini-wave (also possible: a
couple). A tandem-based triangle has the dancers in the base usually in
a tandem (also possible: facing or back-to-back dancers).
