# Step and Squeeze

From a General Line: The Centers step forward as the Ends Squeeze. 
A Line with Centers facing the same direction ends in a Box (2×2);
a Line with Centers facing opposite directions ends in a “Z” (2×3).
Note: This call always ends in the same general formation 
(2×2, 2×3 (Z), 3×4, or others) as [Step and Flip](step_and_flip.md), 
when used with the same facing directions. 
See the diagrams in Step and Flip for examples.
For Step and Squeeze, 
those who Squeeze will also have gone past each other 
(#1 goes past #4, #5 goes past #8).
