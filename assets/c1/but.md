# \<main call> But \<anything>

This syntax describes a specific modification to \<main call> 
in which one or more parts of \<main call> are replaced with <anything>. 
Some call definitions describe what "But" means when used
with that call. (See Percolate, for example.) 
Otherwise, "But" means that the Centers replace their
last part of \<main call> with \<anything> 
while the other dancers complete \<main call> normally.
To use "But" in this way there must be a clear last part for the Centers, 
it must occur only in the
center, and it must not involve interacting with the other dancers.

Example Calls:
- Chain Reaction But 2/3 Recycle (replace the Cast Off 3/4)
- Mini Busy But Cut the Diamond (replace Flip the Diamond)
- Load the Boat But Spin the Top (replace the Centers’ final Pass Thru)

Notes:

1. Callers often use the word "but" in its common English sense 
   simply to warn dancers to listen for a modification, 
   as in "\<main call> but \<modifying words>". The words that follow,
   using modifying terms such as Replace, Omit, Interrupt, Turn the Star, 
   or On the 3rd Hand, describe the details of the modification. 
   Using "but" is completely optional in these usages,
   and should not be confused with the more specific "But" modifier presented here

2. While the "But" definition uses the phrase "clear last part for the Centers",
   it is not intended to require the call definition to have formally defined parts
   with language such as "This call has N parts." "But" is simply intended to be a
   shorthand replacement for the phrase "Centers Replace the Last Part With"
   and may be used whenever that phrase would be clear.
 
3. Calls such as Chain Reaction and Tally Ho have their last part defined 
   by terms other than "Centers", such as 
   "Those who meet Cast Off 3/4 while the others move up." The dancers who
   "meet" and finish the call in the center are considered Centers 
   for the purposes of the "But" modifier.
 
4. "But" may only be used with 8-dancer calls, and the calls must have 
   multiple parts for the dancers who finish in the center. 
   For example, it is not proper to use "But" with Acey Deucey
   or Trade By because the Centers have only one part.
 
5. Some calls that do have a "clear last part for the Centers" may be confusing 
   to use with the simple "But" because they have been traditionally modified 
   in a different way. For example:
   - "Spin the Windmill". The Centers do have a clear last part (Cast Off 3/4) 
     but callers more frequently modify the Outsides’ part.
   - "Plenty". The Centers do have a clear last part (1/2 Zoom), 
     but callers more frequently modify the Split Circulates.
   
   Using a simple "But" with these calls to replace the Centers’ last part 
   would likely be confusing to the dancers and is not recommended. 
   Instead, callers should use more explicit terminology, such as 
   "Spin the Windmill Left, Centers replace the Cast Off 3/4 with \<anything>."
   Other calls with alternative common modifications include 
   Square the Bases and Pass the Axle. 
   Please refer to those call definitions for the proper use of “But” with those calls.
