# Replace / Skip / Delete

## Replace

- Dancers can be asked to replace (or substitute) one or more
parts of the call (including the remainder of the call) with a
different dance action. The part to be replaced can be described by
its part number (for example, "the third part") or by its dance action (for example,
"the stars", "the centers trade"). See also,
But. Examples: "Scoot and
Plenty, Replace the Split Circulates with a Motivate", "Swing the
Fractions, Replace the third part with a Split Circulate", "Scoot and
Plenty, Replace the Box Circulates with an Explode the Wave and do not
finish the Plenty".

## Skip

- A shorthand for "Replace With Nothing". Example: "Pass the Axle, Skip the third part".

## Delete

- Another shorthand for "Replace With Nothing". Example: "Delete all arm turn 1/2's and Spin Chain the Gears".

Special note for Replace, Interrupt, Skip, and Delete: All of
these modifiers may change each dancer's position in the formation or
even change the formation itself. When the dancers resume their
execution of the call, they must reevaluate their position in the
formation and their new part in the definition. Examples: "Square Chain
Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the Top" and "Swing
the Fractions, Interrupt after each part with a Circulate".
