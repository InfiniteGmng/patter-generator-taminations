# Butterfly Formation / Concept

A Butterfly is a Column formation with the Ends of the Column 
separated by two positions.

## Butterfly Circulate

From a Butterfly: All dancers move
forward one position along the path as shown:

## Other Butterfly calls, such as Split Circulate, Walk and Dodge

Any call which can be done from General
Columns (Columns, Double Pass Thru formation, etc.), and that ends
in General Lines or Columns, can be done from a Butterfly.
The dancers act as though the Ends were close together;
however, they end on the original eight spots on the floor. For
example, "Butterfly [ Double Pass Thru](../b1/double_pass_thru.md)":

The ending formation is always the same as though the
Ends stepped together, everyone did the call, and the Ends
slid apart again--the same eight spots on the floor are
occupied at the end of the call as when it began.
