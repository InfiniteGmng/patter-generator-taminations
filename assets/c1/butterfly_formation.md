# Butterfly Formation / Concept

A Butterfly is a column formation with the ends of the column separated by 2 positions.

**Butterfly Circulate**  
From a Butterfly: All dancers move
forward one position along the path as shown:

**Other Butterfly calls, such as Split Circulate, Walk and Dodge**  
Any call which can be done from General
Columns (columns, double pass thru, etc.), and which ends
in General Lines or Columns, can be done from a Butterfly.
The dancers act as though the ends were close together;
however, they end on the original 8 spots on the floor. For
example, "Butterfly [ Double Pass Thru](../b1/double_pass_thru.md)":

The ending formation is always the same as though the
ends stepped together, everyone did the call, and the ends
slid apart again--the same eight spots on the floor are
occupied at the end of the call as when it began.
