# Relay the Shadow

From a tidal wave:
***All [Swing](../a2/swing.md)***.
***The center six [Cast 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md),
while the ends [Counter Rotate 1/4](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md),
meet the very centers,***
***Single [Hinge](../ms/hinge.md) &
[Spread](../plus/anything_and_spread.md).
The other four do the centers' part
of a [Cast a Shadow](relay_the_shadow.md)*** (i.e., leaders "shadow", trailers
[Extend](../b2/extend.md), [Hinge](../ms/hinge.md), and
[Extend](../b2/extend.md)).
