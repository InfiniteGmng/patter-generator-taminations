# Recycle variations

## Recycle

At C-1, the version of this call that starts from a wave is defined to have three parts:
First, the centers Fold and all adjust to make a box-circulate formation. Then all Box Counter
Rotate 1/4. Then all Roll. The result is the same as the Mainstream definition.

## All 8 Recycle

From a 1/4 Tag, or Wave between Parallel Mini-Waves: 
The centers do a [Recycle](../ms/recycle.md), working
wider than normal, and ending on the outside.
Meanwhile, the outsides move into the center and Recycle
([Facing Couples Recycle](../a2/recycle.md) or
Box Recycle, as appropriate),
ending in the center. This ends in a 1/4 Tag.

## 2/3 Recycle

From a wave only: Do the first two parts of Recycle, that is,
[Centers Fold](../ms/fold.md) (and all adjust to a Box Circulate formation),
then [Box Counter Rotate 1/4](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md).

## Split / Box Recycle

From Box Circulate formation:
Without letting go hands with the leaders, the trailers
[Extend](../b2/extend.md) and
[U-Turn Back](../b1/turn_back.md), to end with their original
outside hands joined. The leaders follow along, becoming
the ends of the resulting Wave.

From 2x2 formations where half the Box is a Couple and
the other is a Right-Hand Mini-Wave: Those in the Couple
do a [Facing-Couples Recycle](../a2/recycle.md),
and those in the Mini-Wave
do a Box Recycle. This ends in a Right-Hand Wave.

This can't be done when the Mini-Wave is left-handed:

The name “Split Recycle” is used from a 2x4 formation to specify that each 2x2 Box does a Box
Recycle.

Where not otherwise ambiguous, it is permissible to call
simply, "Recycle" when you mean "Split Recycle", "Box Recycle" or "Facing Recycle".
For example, from Columns, you could call
"Outsides [Partner Tag](../a1/partner_tag.md)
while the centers Recycle" and the meaning is clear.
From Parallel Waves, though, "Recycle" and "Split Recycle"
are different because the first applies Recycle to
each Wave and the second applies Recycle to each Box.
