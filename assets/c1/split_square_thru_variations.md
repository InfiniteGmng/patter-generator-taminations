# Split Square Thru Variations


These calls start from appropriate T-Bone Boxes
(each box consists of a trailing Couple and two
Facing Dancers) or a Static Square.
The action always begins with “those facing Right Pull By and
[Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md)”
(to face those who didn't pull by).
From a Static Square, the caller will designate the
couples (heads or sides) who will move into the center and
perform the part of the facing dancers

Comment: Using the helper word “Start” can cause confusion with the “Start” modifier. 
Here are proper call examples:

- From a Static Square, call “Heads Split Dixie Diamond”;
- From T-Bone Boxes, call “Split Dixie Diamond”.

## Split Square Chain the Top
From a appropriate T-Bone Box:
Those facing right [Pull By](../b1/pull_by.md) and
[Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md);
all Left [Spin the Top](../ms/spin_the_top.md);
all Left [Turn Thru](../ms/turn_thru.md).
Ends in Back-to-Back Couples.

## Split Dixie Style to a Wave
From an appropriate T-Bone Box:
Those facing Right [Pull By](../b1/pull_by.md) and
[Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md);
all Left [Touch 1/4](../b2/touch_a_quarter.md). 
Ends in a Left-Hand Box.

## Split Dixie Diamond
From appropriate T-Bone Boxes:
Split Dixie Style to a Wave; the Centers Hinge while the Ends
U-Turn Back (turning toward each other). 
From a T-bone setup with Centers facing each other
and Ends facing in as a couple, 
Split Dixie Diamond ends in Right-Hand Twin Diamonds.

## Split Dixie Sashay
From appropriate T-Bone Boxes: Split Dixie Style to a Wave; Slither.
Ends in Parallel Left-Hand Two-Faced Lines.
(Dancers should anticipate the Slither action and blend smoothly into it
from the Left Touch 1/4 action that concludes Split Dixie Style to a Wave.)
