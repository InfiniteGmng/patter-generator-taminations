# Chase Your Neighbor

From Back-to-Back Couples only: 
In one smooth motion, Belles U-Turn Back to the right
and all Box Circulate; Follow Your Neighbor. 
Ends in a Left-Hand Wave. This call feels like beginning a
[Chase Right](../plus/chase_right.md) and blending into a
[Follow Your Neighbor](../plus/follow_your_neighbor.md).
