# Chase Your Neighbor

From couples back to back: Start a 
[Chase Right](../plus/chase_right.md), blending into a 
[Follow Your Neighbor](../plus/follow_your_neighbor.md): 
The original beaus begin the [Chase Right](../plus/chase_right.md), 
meet each other, and
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md). 
The original belles begin the [Zoom](../b2/zoom.md) action, but
after passing each other, they "[Fold](../ms/fold.md) and 
[Roll](../plus/anything_and_roll.md)" to finish as the ends of a wave.
