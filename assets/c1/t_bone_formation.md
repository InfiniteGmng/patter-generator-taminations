# T-Bone Formation

Definition: A T-Bone formation is one where some people
are in Lines or Waves and some are in Columns, for example,

>

To do a call "T-Bone", do your part of the call, regardless of
how the other people are facing. Examples:

> 
> ![alt](t_bone_1.png)  
> ![alt](t_bone_2.png)  
> ![alt](t_bone_3.png)  
> ![alt](t_bone_4.png)  
> 

The caller does not actually say the words "T-Bone".
Dancers are expected to recognize the formation and
do the call accordingly.
