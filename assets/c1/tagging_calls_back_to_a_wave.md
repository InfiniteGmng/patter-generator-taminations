# \<Tag> Back Family

"\<Tag>" indicates a short name for a "tagging call", that is, 
a call similar to Tag the Line in that it
has a 1/2 Tag position, a 3/4 Tag position, and so on. 
Three tagging calls are part of the C-1 program;
their names are:
* "Tag" for Tag the Line
* "Flip" for Flip the Line
* "Vertical Tag" (no shorter name)

All calls in the <Tag> Back family have 2 parts:
1. Do the tagging call to the 1/2 Tag position.
2. [Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md).

## Flip Back 
From a Wave:
***[Flip The Line 1/2](flip_the_line.md)***, then
***[Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md)***.
Ends in a Box Circulate formation.

## Tag Back
From a Line or Wave:
***[1/2 Tag](../ms/tag.md)***;
***[Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md)***.
Ends in Box Circulate formation.

## Vertical Tag Back
From a Box of Four that is not T-Boned:
***[Vertical 1/2 Tag](vertical_tag.md)***;
***[Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md)***.
Ends in Box Circulate formation.

Historical Note: The calls (Vertical) Tag Back were 
previously named (Vertical) Tag Back to a Wave.
The names were shortened in 2024 to reduce confusion 
with the “<anything> To a Wave” modifier
and to make these names consistent with the other call 
in this family, Flip Back.
