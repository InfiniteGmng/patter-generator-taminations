# Magic Column Circulate

From magic columns: Each dancer moves forward along
one of the two circulate paths shown below:

If an end and a center are facing each other, they pass
using the end's inside shoulder (the center dancer moves
first). This takes the place of the right-shoulder rule. So
Magic Column Circulate 1Â½ would end like so:

Teaching Hint: You can point out that the ends are
holding opposite hands from the centers--e.g., the ends
have right hands joined, and the centers have left hands
joined.

If you leave the circulate path (e.g., in Magic Column
Transfer, shown below), just finish the call as usual. In
this example, the ending wave is left-handed because the
centers have lefts before the final Extend:

In the case of Magic Column [Walk and Dodge](../ms/walk_and_dodge.md), the rules
are the same: Those who are doing the Walk follow the
circulate path, and those doing the Dodge (and thus
leaving the circulate path) just slide sideways as usual:

Note:
Magic column calls are only permitted where complete
magic columns exist. It would be improper, for example, to
call "Magic Walk and Dodge" from an inverted box in
isolation.

Note: At C-1 this concept is restricted to right or left-hand Magic Columns only.
