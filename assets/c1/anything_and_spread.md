# (Anything) and Spread

In addition to the three ways [Spread](../plus/anything_and_spread.md) is used at
Plus, there is a fourth way:

If specific dancers are directed to Spread (for example, Everyone Trade, Boys
Spread), they slide away from the adjacent dancer one position. The
inactive dancers do not move. This can be used to create an Hourglass
(From #0 Lines: Touch 1/4, Column Circulate 1 1/2, Center 6 Trade, Girls
Spread), Blocks (From #0 Lines: Touch 1/4, Boys Spread, Check Blocks),
or other formations.
