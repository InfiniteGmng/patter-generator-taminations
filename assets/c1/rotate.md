# Rotate Family

The following calls start from a Static Square,
or a Static Square with some couples facing out (for
example, after Heads Partner Trade).
This is the only permitted starting formation at C-1. 

## Rotate

Working As Couples, the designated outside dancers turn
1/4 in place to face promenade direction and
[Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md)
the designated fraction (or 1/4, if none is specified) around the outside of the
square, while the other dancers step forward into the
middle. This is a restricted definition for C-1, using only
the permitted formation of a static square.
