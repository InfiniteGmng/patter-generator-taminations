# Rotate Family

At C-1, the following calls are used only from a Static Square or any other formation in which the
designated dancers can act as Ends of General Columns (see "When the Formation Isnâ€™t There",
page 8). The designated dancers must be named explicitly to avoid confusion with other Rotate
applications that involve all 8 dancers (not part of the C-1 program).
* For Rotate and Reverse Rotate, the designated dancers must be Couples.
* For Single Rotate and Reverse Single Rotate, 
the designated dancers must be Couples or in Mini-Waves.
* These calls all include a fraction, which is required.
