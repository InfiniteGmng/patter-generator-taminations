# Circle By

From Facing Couples: This call requires that two
fractions, m and n, be called as part of its name, for example,
"Circle By 1/4 and 1/2". All join hands and [Circle Left](../b1/circle.md) m. 
Then Touch and Cast Off n. If n is "Nothing", you
just step to the wave. The second fraction (n), may be
replaced by another call, as in "Circle By 1/2 and [Recycle](../ms/recycle.md)". 
In that case, the Cast Off is replaced by the call
specified. In this example, the dancers would [Circle Left](../b1/circle.md)
1/2, Touch, then [Recycle](../ms/recycle.md), ending in Facing Couples.
