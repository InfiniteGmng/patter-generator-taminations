# Split Counter Rotate

At Advanced, [Split Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) is proper
only from a 2x4 formation (Diamonds are being added in 2021). At C-1, this restriction is removed: each
half of the square does a Counter Rotate around the center point of
its side. For example, Split Counter Rotate from a Tidal Wave gives
Parallel Waves, and Split Counter Rotate turns Diamonds into
Point-to-Point Diamonds and vice-versa.
