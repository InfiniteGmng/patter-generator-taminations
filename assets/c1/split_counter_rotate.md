# Split Counter Rotate

At Advanced, [Split Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md) is proper
only from a 2x4 formation(for example, Parallel Waves or Columns), 
or from Twin or Point-to-Point Diamonds. At C-1, this
restriction is removed. The call can begin from any setup that can be divided
across its long axis into two side-by-side four-dancer formations 
with no dancers facing directly toward or away from the center point 
of their group of four. Each such four-dancer group does a Counter Rotate around
the center point of their formation. 
For example, Split Counter Rotate from a Tidal Wave ends in Parallel Waves.
