# Alter the Wave

From a Wave: ***All [Swing](../a2/slip.md)***,
then ***the Centers [Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md)
while the Ends [ U-Turn Back](../b1/turn_back.md)***.
***All [ Counter Rotate](counter_rotate.md) the
diamond 1/2 (formerly called "turning the Star 1/2")***, and
***[Flip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md)***. Ends in a Wave.

One can also "Counter Rotate the Diamond" by other
amounts than 1/2. For example, "Alter the Wave, but
Counter Rotate the Diamond 3/4":

*Teaching Hint:* One can think of the Counter Rotate as two 
[Diamond Circulates](../plus/diamond_circulate.md) (except that the Centers of the Diamond
remain Centers throughout).
