## Square the Bases But \<anything>

Callers have historically used "Square the Bases But \<anything>" 
in a variety of ways, including replacing the Centers’ final part, 
replacing the Split Square Thru 2, or replacing the Split Square Thru 2 
and the Trade By. With the adoption of the general "But" modifier in 2023
(see [But](but.md)), callers are expected to use "Square the Bases But \<anything>" 
only to replace the Centers’ final part (Pass Thru). 
Callers should use other terminology for other replacements,
such as "Square the Bases, Replace the Split Square Thru 2 with \<anything>." 
Callers may also refer to the numbered parts; for example, 
"Square the Bases, Replace the second part with \<anything>," or 
"Square the Bases, Replace the last two parts with \<anything>."
