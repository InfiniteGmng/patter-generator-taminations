## Plenty

From 1/4 Tag or 3/4 Tag: This call has 3 parts:

Ends in a 1/4 Tag.

Notes: The caller can vary the number of Split Circulates (for example, "Plenty,
do 3 Split Circulates", "Plenty, but Split Circulate 3").

From Diamonds, if you want the points to go as they are, the proper
usage is "Plenty, points go as you are". The command "Plenty" would
start with the points doing a 1/4 Right.

Since the first part is a Little, the outside dancers normally begin with
a Quarter Right but the caller can tell them to quarter in a different
direction (e.g., "Plenty, outsides face in", "Left Plenty" (the outsides
quarter left), "Right Plenty" (the outsides quarter right).

## Scoot and Plenty

From a 1/4 Tag: [Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md), then
Right Plenty or Left Plenty, depending on the hand with
which the Scoot Back was done; the outsides can also
take a direction, as in "Scoot and Plenty, Outsides Out."

## Left Scoot and Plenty

From a Left-Hand Quarter Tag only: (This usage is to be avoided, except when helping the
dancers. This call is no different from Scoot and Plenty from this formation.) Scoot Back, then
Left Plenty. The outsides always go to the left.

Notes: Traditional usage says that on a Plenty the outsides go to the Right. This makes sense
because they shouldn't be responsible for the handedness of the ocean wave behind them.
Traditional usage has the outsides on a Scoot and Plenty from a left-hand quarter tag go to the
left. This makes sense because it is one call and the dancers just used the left hand on the Scoot
Back, so they should automatically continue to the left after the Scoot Back.

From a Left-Hand 1/4 Tag, the command “Scoot Back and Plenty” is two calls, and the outsides
should go to the right even though “Scoot and Plenty” would have them go to the left. It is
unfortunate that these two similar-sounding phrases have a different dance action. Callers
should avoid trying to trick dancers in this way.

On a Left 3/4 Tag and Plenty, dancers will go to the right. Use Left 3/4 Tag and Left Plenty to
have the dancers go to the left.

From a Left-Hand 1/4 Tag, Scoot Chain Thru and Plenty will have the dancers go to the right.
Use Scoot Chain Thru and Left Plenty to have the dancers go to the left.
