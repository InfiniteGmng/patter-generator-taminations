Ends in quarter tag.

Notes: The caller can vary the number of Split Circulates (for example, "Plenty,
do 3 Split Circulates", "Plenty, but Split Circulate 3").

From Diamonds, if you want the points to go as they are, the proper
usage is "Plenty, points go as you are". The command "Plenty" would
start with the points doing a 1/4 Right.

Since the first part is a Little, the outside dancers normally begin with
a Quarter Right but the caller can tell them to quarter in a different
direction (e.g., "Plenty, outsides face in", "Left Plenty" (the outsides
quarter left), "Right Plenty" (the outsides quarter right).

## Scoot and Plenty

From a 1/4 Tag: [Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md), then
Right Plenty or Left Plenty, depending on the hand with
which the Scoot Back was done; the outsides can also
take a direction, as in "Scoot and Plenty, Outsides Out."
