# Tandem Concept

Similar to the "As Couples" concept, but the two dancers
that work as a unit are a tandem. Nobody ever comes
between the dancers in a tandem. For example, 
Tandem [Swing Thru](../b2/swing_thru.md):

Common applications include Touch 1/4, Hinge, Scoot Back, Swing Thru, Walk and Dodge.
