# Ah So

From a wave or line: With each half of the wave/line working as a unit, the ends
[ Cross Fold](../ms/fold.html) and the centers
follow along so as to keep each mini-wave or couple intact. If the ends start out facing the same way, they pass right
shoulders as they go.

Teaching Hint: This call is a more general version of
[ Wheel and Deal](../b2/wheel_and_deal.html)â€”the
centers are just turned around.
