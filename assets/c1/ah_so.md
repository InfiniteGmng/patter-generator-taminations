# Ah So

From a Wave or Line: With each half of the Wave or Line 
working as a unit, the Ends
[Cross Fold](../ms/fold.md) and the Centers
follow along so as to keep each Mini-Wave or Couple intact. 
If the Ends start out facing the same way, they pass right
shoulders as they go.

*Teaching Hint:* This call is a more general version of
[Wheel and Deal](../b2/wheel_and_deal.md)â€”the
Centers are just turned around.
