# Ah So

From a Wave or Line: With each half of the Wave/Line working as a unit, the ends
[Cross Fold](../ms/fold.md) and the centers
follow along so as to keep each Mini-Wave or Couple intact. 
If the ends start out facing the same way, they pass right
shoulders as they go.

*Teaching Hint:* This call is a more general version of
[Wheel and Deal](../b2/wheel_and_deal.md)â€”the
centers are just turned around.
