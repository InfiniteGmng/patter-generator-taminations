# Percolate

From appropriate Parallel Waves or Lines, or Eight Chain
Thru formation:
{high:Part1}[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md){/high};
{high:Part2}1/2 Circulate{/high};
{high:Part3}the center 4 (those in the wave)
[Hinge](../ms/hinge.md){/high}
and {high:Part4}[Cross](../a1/anything_and_cross.md){/high}
while {high:Part3}the ends [Turn Thru](../ms/turn_thru.md) 
or Left Turn Thru{/high} as appropriate. From
most places (for example, waves) this ends in lines Back-to-Back.
It can be done from anywhere the Circulate, 1/2 Circulate gives
a definite center Wave.

"Percolate But" means the Hinge and Cross is replaced by the "But" call.
The ends complete the call as usual.
