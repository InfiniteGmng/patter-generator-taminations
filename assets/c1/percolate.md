# Percolate

From appropriate Parallel Waves or Lines, or Eight Chain
Thru formation:
***[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md)***;
***1/2 Circulate***;
***the center 4 (those in the wave)
[Hinge](../ms/hinge.md)
and [Cross](../a1/anything_and_cross.md)***
while ***the ends [Turn Thru](../ms/turn_thru.md) 
or Left Turn Thru*** as appropriate. From
most places (for example, waves) this ends in Lines Back-to-Back.
It can be done from anywhere the Circulate, 1/2 Circulate gives
a definite center Wave.

"Percolate But" means the Hinge and Cross is replaced by the "But" call.
The ends complete the call as usual.
