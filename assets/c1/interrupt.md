# Interrupt

The dance action of the call will temporarily be suspended at one or
more places, at which point the specified action will be performed.
The place can be described by its part (for example, "after the third part")
or by its definition (for example, "before turning the stars"). Example:
"Square Chain Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the
Top".

Special note for Replace, Interrupt, But, Skip, and Delete: All of
these modifiers may change each dancer's position in the formation or
even change the formation itself. When the dancers resume their
execution of the call, they must reevaluate their position in the
formation and their new part in the definition. Examples: "Square Chain
Thru, Interrupt before the last part with a Spin the Top" and "Swing
the Fractions, Interrupt after each part with a Circulate".
