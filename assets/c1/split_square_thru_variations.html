<h2>Split Square Thru Variations</h2>

<p>
  These calls start from appropriate T-Bone Boxes
  (each box consists of a trailing Couple and two
  Facing Dancers) or a Static Square.
  The action always begins with “those facing Right Pull By and
  <a href="../a1/quarter_in.html"> Quarter In</a>”
  (to face those who didn't pull by).
  From a Static Square, the caller will designate the
  couples (heads or sides) who will move into the center and
  perform the part of the facing dancers
</p>
<p>Comment: Using the helper word “Start” can cause confusion with the “Start” modifier. Here are proper call examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From a Static Square, call “Heads Split Dixie Diamond”;</li>
    <li>From T-Bone Boxes, call “Split Dixie Diamond”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    <b>Split Dixie Sashay</b>.
