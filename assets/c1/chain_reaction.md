# Chain Reaction

At C-1, the restrictions from the Advanced Program on the
formations from which you may call [Chain Reaction](../a1/chain_reaction.md) are
removed. In effect, this adds 1/4 Lines and a Two-Faced
Line or a Wave between Parallel Mini-Waves to the list of
starting formations. Examples:

Right-Hand 1/4 Line:
