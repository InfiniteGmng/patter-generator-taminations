# All Eight Recycle

From a 1/4 Tag, or Wave between
Parallel Mini-Waves: The centers do a [Recycle](../ms/recycle.md), working
wider than normal, and ending on the outside.
Meanwhile, the outsides move into the center and Recycle
([Facing Couples Recycle](../a2/recycle.md) or
[Split Recycle](box_split_recycle.md), as appropriate),
ending in the center. This ends in a 1/4 Tag.
