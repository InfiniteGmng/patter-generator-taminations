# Counter Rotate

From any formation with no dancers facing directly
toward or away from the flagpole center: Each dancer
moves forward the designated number of quarters (1/4
unless otherwise specified) around the flagpole center of
the formation, staying the same distance from that
center as though moving on a wheel turning about that
center. With each quarter a dancer Counter Rotates, the
dancer faces a new wall (turns 90 degrees).

The original outsides always finish as outsides, and the
original centers always finish as centers. For example,
"Points Counter Rotate 1/4":

*Teaching Hint:* From parallel waves, people tend to try to 
[Split Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md). Describing the action, from that
formation only, as "[Concentric](concentric_concept.md) 
[Box Counter Rotate](../a2/box_counter_rotate.md)" helps a great deal.

Also see the C-1 extension for
[Split Counter Rotate](split_counter_rotate.md).
