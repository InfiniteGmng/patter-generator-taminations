# Regroup

From Parallel Lines or any other formation
in which the Centers are Couples or Mini-Waves and
the Outsides can act as Ends of Lines: 
The Centers Trade and Roll while the Outsides Quarter
Out, Trade, and ["O" Circulate](o_formation.md). 
(See “When the Formation Isn’t There”, page 8, for the interpretation
of Ends of Lines and O Circulate when the formation isn’t a 2×4.) 
From Parallel Lines, Regroup ends in Facing Lines.
