# Pass the Axle / The Axle

## Pass the Axle

From Eight Chain Thru:
***All [Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md)***,
***the Centers [Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md) 
while the Ends [Cross Cast Back](cast_back.md)***.
***All [Swing](../a2/slip.md)***,
and ***the new Centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md)***.

## The Axle

From Trade-By or Completed Double Pass Thru:
***The Centers [Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md), if they can,
while the Ends [Cross Cast Back](cast_back.md)***.
***All [Swing](../a2/slip.md)***,
and ***the new Centers [Trade](../b2/trade.md)***.

## (Pass) The Axle (but) Cast (Off) N/4
Replace the Swing with Cast Off N/4. Some callers prefer to omit
the "but" to avoid possible confusion with the general "But" modifier 
(see ["But"](but.md), and below). Other callers prefer to include
the "but" to make it clear this is a modification.

## (Pass) The Axle But \<anything>
For an \<anything> call that is not "Cast (Off) N/4," 
this follows the general "But" modifier (see ["But"](but.md)). 
The Centers replace their final Trade with <anything>. 
Example: "Pass the Axle But Chase Right".

Note: There is no ambiguity between the two possible usages of "but" here 
because the call "Cast Off N/4" is not a suitable replacement 
for the Centersâ€™ final Trade.
