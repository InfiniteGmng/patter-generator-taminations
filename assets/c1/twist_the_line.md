# Twist the Line / Twist and \<anything>

## Twist the Line

From a Line, centers facing the same way, and sexes
arranged appropriately: The centers step forward and 
[Partner Trade](../b2/trade.md) while the ends face, move in, and 
[Star Thru](../b1/star_thru.md). This is a gender-dependent call (because of the Star
Thru).

## Twist and \<anything>

From a Line, centers facing the
same way: The centers step forward and [Partner Trade](../b2/trade.md)
while the ends face, move in, and do the Anything call--which will involve 
only the original ends unless otherwise
specified For example, "Twist and [Square Thru 2](../b1/square_thru.md)":
