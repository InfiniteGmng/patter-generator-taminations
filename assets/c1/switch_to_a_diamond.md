# Switch to a Diamond

At Advanced,
[this call is done from a wave only](../a2/switch_to_a_diamond.md); at
C-1, it may start from a general line. If the ends are facing the same way
at the start, they meet with right hands, and adjust so the call ends in a
diamond (rather than having the centers offset).
