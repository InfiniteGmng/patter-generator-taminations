# Block Formation

A block is a 4x4 matrix in which no 2 real bodies have a
real body between them. There is 1 space between all
bodies in a block: in front, in back, left and right.

In blocks you can do only 4-person calls (or sequences of
calls) that start and end in a 2x2 formation. e.g. [Partner Trade](../b2/trade.md), 
[Partner Tag](../a1/partner_tag.md), [Pass Thru](../b1/pass_thru.md),
[Touch 1/4](../b2/touch_a_quarter.md), 
[Star Thru](../b1/star_thru.md), [Square Thru](../b1/square_thru.md), 
[Wheel Thru](../a1/wheel_thru.md), etc. When doing a call in a
block, each dancer works only with the dancers in his
block; all block calls start and end on the same 4 spots on
the floor.
e.g., In Your Block, [Walk and Dodge](../ms/walk_and_dodge.md):

For some calls, e.g., In Your Block, [Square Chain Thru](../a1/square_chain_thru.md),
the dancers are working in a wave during the call's action.
In that case, the waves are slightly offset from each other,
just as the blocks are slightly offset.
e.g., In Your Block, [Square Chain Thru](../a1/square_chain_thru.md):
