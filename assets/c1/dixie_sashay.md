# Dixie Sashay

From Facing Couples or Facing Tandems:
[Dixie Style to A Wave](../ms/dixie_style.md);
[Slither](../a2/slip.md).
Ends in a Left-Hand Two-Faced Line. (Dancers
should anticipate the Slither action and blend smoothly into it from
the Left Touch 1/4 action that concludes Dixie Style to a Wave.)
