# Left

Do the call interchanging right with left, clockwise with
counter-clockwise, and promenade with reverse promenade. This modifier
is usually used with calls which start with a Pull By or Pass Thru
(i.e., "Left Pass And Roll" and "Left Square Chain Thru", but not
"Left Swap Around"). In Challenge dancing, the left versions of the
calls are part of the program even though they are not explicitly
listed.
