# \<anything> to a Wave

From wherever is appropriate for the \<anything> call:
The \<anything> call must have as its final action
a Step Thru or Extend.
Do the \<anything> call, except for the final Step Thru or Extend. 

For example, in [Square Chain Thru to a Wave](../a1/square_chain_thru.md), the dancers
would do all of the call except for stepping forward on the
final Turn Thru:

> ![alt](anything_to_a_wave_1a.png)
> ![alt](anything_to_a_wave_1b.png)
> ![alt](anything_to_a_wave_1c.png)
> 

[Square Thru 3](../b1/square_thru.md) to a Wave:

> 
> ![alt](anything_to_a_wave_2.png)
>

Additional applications include Scoot Chain Thru To A Wave, Load the
Boat Centers to a Wave, Percolate Outsides to a Wave, Flip Back to a
Wave, or Tag Back to a Wave to a Wave.

Callers wanting to use this modifier with (Vertical) Tag Back 
should use additional words for clarity,
such as "Tag Back, Centers to a Wave". 
This avoids confusion with the old call names (Vertical) Tag
Back to a Wave. See the Historical Note in the definition of 
[\<Tag> Back](tagging_calls_back_to_a_wave.md).

Do not be confused by calls which contain "to a Wave" as part of their
name (for example, "Single Circle to a Wave", "Right Roll to a Wave",
"Cross Roll to a Wave").
