# Vertical Tag (1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full)

From Box Circulate, Facing Couples, etc.:

- Dancers in a trailing couple have the belle step in front of the beau, forming a tandem
- Dancers in a leading couple [Single Wheel](../a2/single_wheel.md)
- Dancers in a mini-wave have the leads [Fold](../ms/fold.md)

After the appropriate beginning, dancers continue in one smooth motion
to finish a Tag the Line
(that is, walk forward for as many tag positions as indicated).
This call cannot be fractionalized.
