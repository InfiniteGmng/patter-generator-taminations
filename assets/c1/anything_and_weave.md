# Weave

From Box Circulate: The leads do 1/2 a [Box Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) while
the trailers walk forward on a slight diagonal to meet each other with their original
outside hands (thought of by some as Cross Extend) and Hinge. From
Single Eight Chain Thru: All Pass Thru, and the ends Quarter Right while
the centers Left Touch 1/4 (this is like Touch and Weave).
