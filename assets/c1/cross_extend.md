# Cross Extend

From a Single 1/4 Tag or Box Circulate: Extend but move on a slight
diagonal so as to end in a formation whose handedness is the opposite
from that of the starting formation. Cross Extend from a Right-Hand
Single 1/4 Tag will end in a Left-Hand Box Circulate. Cross Extend from
a Right-Hand Box Circulate ends in a Left-Hand Single 3/4 Tag.

Notes: Cross Extend is a 4-dancer call. The common 8-dancer starting
formations are 1/4 Tag and Parallel Waves.

From a 1/4 Tag, since those in the center Wave are most aware of its
handedness, it is important for them to meet the outside dancers with
the correct hand. 

From Parallel Waves there is a tendency for the original Leaders to cross
or Half Sashay with each other. This would be incorrect because the two
Box Circulate formations should not interact. The original Leaders
simply move straight ahead and adjust to form a Couple in the resulting
3/4 Tag formation.
