## Little

From a 1/4 Tag or 3/4 Tag: Outsides 1/4 Right, or
as directed, and then [Counter Rotate 1/4](counter_rotate.md).
Centers [Step and Fold](step_and_fold.md).
Ends in Parallel Waves or Lines. The quartering direction for
the outsides may be specified, as in "Left Little" or "Right Little"
(outsides go left or right, respectively).

From Diamonds, there are many ways to direct the points to
Counter Rotate without turning first, including: "Little, points go as
you are", "Little, Points go forward", and "Centers Start, Little".
(See Glossary of Modifying Terms: [Start](start.md).) The command "Little"
(with no direction given) requires the points to 1/4 Right before they
Counter Rotate. See the historical note below.

Consider the following two cases:

> ![alt](little_2b.png)
> ![alt](little_2c.png)

Historical note: In a previous definition Diamonds were a
special exception because, without any words by the caller, the points
would automatically go forward. Today the caller must direct the
points to go "as you are".


## Scoot and Little

From a 1/4 Tag:
***[Scoot Back](../ms/scoot_back.md),*** then
***Little or Left Little***,
according to the hand with which
the Scoot Back was done, or outsides go as directed, as in
"Scoot and Little, Out on the outside".

## Left Scoot and Little

From a Left-Hand 1/4 Tag only: (This usage is to be avoided, except when helping the dancers.
This call is no different from Scoot and Little from this formation.) Scoot Back, then Left Little.
The outsides always go to the left.
