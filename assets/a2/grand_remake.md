# Grand Remake

From right-hand columns (of 6 or 8): Those who can Turn 1/4 by the Right, those who can Turn 1/2 by
the Left, and those who can Turn 3/4 by the Right.

For each part of the call, there must be a dancer performing this part and the immediately preceding
or following one. For example, the call is not proper from Magic Columns.

The left-hand version of Grand Remake is called "Left Grand Remake".
