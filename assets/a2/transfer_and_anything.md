# Transfer and (Anything)

Timing: 8 (any starts on 5)

From columns (or other applicable formation): The #1 and #2 dancers
[Transfer The Column](../a1/transfer_the_column.md), omitting
the final Extend, ending as an in-facing couple on the outside. The
other dancers walk forward to form a box (or other compact formation;
this may be less than a full circulate) in the center and do the
(Anything) call.

Example: Transfer and [ Quarter Thru](../a1/quarter_thru.md)
