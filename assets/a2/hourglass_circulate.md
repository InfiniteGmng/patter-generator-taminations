hourglass, to take that dancer's place. Dancers move along the path shown:

Points become centers, and centers become points. Also, the diamond dancers move to the
box, and the box dancers move to the diamond.

For Teaching: Tell each dancer to move up to the next person's spot in the hourglass,
taking his footsteps. During this call, everyone keeps the same shoulder toward the center
of the set. This is a good call for using a demonstration square.

## Cut/Flip the Hourglass

### Cut the Hourglass

Timing: 6

From an Hourglass: The points slide together and [Trade](../b2/trade.md), while the others
[Hourglass Circulate](hourglass_circulate.md). Ends in Parallel Lines or Waves.

### Flip the Hourglass

Timing: 4

From an Hourglass: The points [ Run](../b2/run.md) to the nearest center (Flip in as
for [Flip the Diamond](../plus/flip_the_diamond.md)), while the others
[Hourglass Circulate](hourglass_circulate.md).
