# Swing and Mix

Timing: 8

From an Ocean Wave or Inverted Line: ends and adjacent centers Turn
1/2; Centers [Cross Run](../b2/run.md); resulting Centers
[Trade](../b2/trade.md). The
[Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) applies to this call.

Note: There are two ways in which Swing and
Mix is not simply the call
[Swing](slip.md) followed by the call
[Mix](../a1/mix.md). 
* First, reflecting historical usage, Swing and Mix is a single call with three
parts while (Any Call) and Mix are two separate calls. 
* Second, from facing couples, Swing and Mix is proper even though Swing is improper.
