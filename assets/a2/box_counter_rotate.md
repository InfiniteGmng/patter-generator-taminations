# Box Counter Rotate

From any 4-dancer formation with no dancers facing the flagpole center [At
Advanced, this call is used only from a 2X2 formation, e.g. Box Circulate]:
This call may have a fraction after it, such as Box Counter Rotate 3/4. If no fraction is
given, it means Box Counter Rotate 1/4.

For each 1/4 in the fraction: Each dancer moves his position in the formation forward
around the center of the formation 90°, by walking forward in a smooth arc to reach that
spot. Each dancer works independently of the other 3 dancers in his formation.

Every dancer can [Roll](../plus/anything_and_roll.md) at the end of this call.

The diagrams below show the beginning and ending positions for a single dancer, for
every spot in a box circulate formation.

Example -- Box Counter Rotate 1/4:

Example—Box Counter Rotate 3/4:

> 
> ![alt](box_counter_rotate_2a.png)![alt](box_counter_rotate_2b.png)![alt](box_counter_rotate_2c.png)![alt](box_counter_rotate_2d.png)
> 

For Teaching: Think of this as Promenading 1/4 in the formation; that captures the
smoothness of the call. You can also have the leads [Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md) and
[Box Circulate](../b1/circulate.md), while the trailers [ Box Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) and
[Quarter In](../a1/quarter_in.md). That gets the dancers to the right place.
