# Remake The Thar

From a Thar or Wrong-Way Thar, end and adjacent center Arm Turn
one-quarter (90°) to form a momentary Alamo ring. In a
continuously flowing movement, everyone releases holds with the
dancer they just turned, and with the other hand, turn the next
dancer one-half (180°) to form another momentary Alamo ring.
Without stopping, they release holds at the completion of the half
turn and, with the other arm, turn the next dancer three-quarters
(270°) to form another Thar or Wrong-Way Thar.


Timing: 10
