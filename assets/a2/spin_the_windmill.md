# Spin the Windmill

Timing: 12

From anywhere with a center Wave or center Facing Couples (for example,
3/4 Tag, Trade By): Centers [Swing](slip.md),
[Slip](slip.md), and
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md),
while the outsides face as directed and
[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md)
two positions. If the centers start in Facing Couples, they first
Touch, then finish the call.

Left Spin the Windmill is the same, except that:

- It may only be used with the centers in Facing Couples or a Left-Hand Wave.
- If the centers are in Facing Couples,
they Left Touch before doing the Swing, Slip, and Cast Off 3/4.

  
For teaching: You can describe the centers' part as
[Swing Thru](../b2/swing_thru.md) and
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md), 
or as Left Swing Thru and Cast Off 3/4, depending on the
handedness of the wave.
