# Spin the Windmill

From anywhere with a center wave or center facing couples (e.g.,
3/4 Tag, Trade By): Centers [Swing](swing.md),
[Slip](slip.md), and
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md),
while the outsides face as directed and
[Circulate](../b1/circulate.md)
two positions. If the centers start in facing couples, they first
Touch, then finish the call.

Left Spin the Windmill is the same, except that:

- It may only be used with the centers in facing couples or a left-hand wave.
- If the centers are in facing couples,
they Left Touch before doing the Swing, Slip, and Cast Off ¾.

  
For teaching: You can describe the centers' part as
[Swing Thru](../b2/swing_thru.md) and
[Cast Off 3/4](../ms/cast_off_three_quarters.md), 
or as Left Swing Thru and Cast Off ¾, depending on the
handedness of the wave.

Timing: 12
