# Remake

From a right hand mini-wave box,
or a left-hand facing diamond:
{high:Part1}Those who can
Turn 1/4 by the Right,{/high}
{high:Part2}those who can Turn 1/2 by the Left,{/high}
{high:Part3}and those who can Turn 3/4 by the Right.{/high}

For each part of the call, there must be a dancer performing this part and the immediately preceding
or following one. For example, the call is not proper from an Inverted Box.

The left-hand version of Remake is called "Left Remake".

The name of the formation may be added at the end of the call (e.g., Remake The Wave)
as a help to the dancers but doing so is optional.

If there are two side-by-side formations, each of which can do the call, dancers don't
move from one to the other. From right-hand columns, for example, each of the two box
circulate formations does the call independently.

The exception to the remake rules is "[Remake The Thar](remake_the_thar.md)".

Timing: Alamo 12, others 10
