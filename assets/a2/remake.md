## Remake

Timing: Alamo 12, others 10

From a Right Hand Mini-Wave Box, or a Left-Hand Facing Diamond:
***Those who can Turn 1/4 by the Right,***
***those who can Turn 1/2 by the Left,***
and ***those who can Turn 3/4 by the Right.***

For each part of the call, there must be a dancer performing this part and the immediately preceding
or following one. For example, the call is not proper from an Inverted Box.

The left-hand version of Remake is called "Left Remake".

The name of the formation may be added at the end of the call (e.g., Remake The Wave)
as a help to the dancers but doing so is optional.

If there are two side-by-side formations, each of which can do the call, dancers don't
move from one to the other. From Right-Hand Columns, for example, each of the two Box
Circulate formations does the call independently.

The exception to the remake rules is "Remake The Thar", defined below.

## Grand Remake

Timing: 10

From Right-Hand Columns (of 6 or 8): ***Those who can Turn 1/4 by the Right***, 
***those who can Turn 1/2 by the Left***, 
and ***those who can Turn 3/4 by the Right***.

For each part of the call, there must be a dancer performing this part and the immediately preceding
or following one. For example, the call is not proper from Magic Columns.

The left-hand version of Grand Remake is called "Left Grand Remake".

# Remake The Thar

Timing: 10

From a Thar or Wrong-Way Thar, ***end and adjacent center Arm Turn
one-quarter (90 degrees)*** to form a momentary Alamo ring. In a
continuously flowing movement, ***everyone releases holds with the
dancer they just turned, and with the other hand, turn the next
dancer one-half (180 degrees) to form another momentary Alamo ring***.
Without stopping, they release holds at the completion of the half
turn and, with the other arm, ***turn the next dancer three-quarters
(270 degrees) to form another Thar or Wrong-Way Thar***.
