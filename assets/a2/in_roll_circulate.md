# In/Out Roll Circulate

## In-Roll Circulate

Timing: 4

From general lines, with the ends forming a tandem: In each line, the end facing in
[Circulates](../b1/circulate.md). Meanwhile, each of the other dancers (in a single, smooth motion) faces the
vacated spot, steps forward, and turns another 1/4 the same way he first turned. Ends back
in parallel lines or waves.

The non-circulators' part is a single motion, rather than a 3-part move. This call can
be fractionalized into halves, as shown below.

For Teaching: You can describe the non-circulators' part as a [ Run](../b2/run.md) (or Flip) toward the
vacated spot. This captures the idea of a single, flowing motion for them.

## Out-Roll Circulate

Timing: 6

From general lines, with the ends forming a tandem: In each line, the end facing out
[Circulates](../b1/circulate.md). Meanwhile, each of the other dancers, in a single, smooth motion, faces the
vacated spot, takes a step forward, and turns another 1/4 in the same direction he first
turned. Ends back in parallel waves or lines.

The non-circulators' part is a single motion, rather than a 3-part move. This call can
be fractionalized into halves, as shown below.
