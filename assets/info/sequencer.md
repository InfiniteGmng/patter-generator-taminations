# Instructions
## Entering Calls

Enter calls by typing into the edit box at the upper left.
Case is not important.  The sequencer recognizes common
synonyms, such as 2/two, through/thru, and will adjust
plurals as needed.  Calls are not case-sensitive.


Erase the last call with the Undo button or by typing "undo".
To erase the current sequence and start a new one, tap the
Reset button or type "reset".

To add a comment, just type a line starting with anything
except a letter or number.

You can also insert comments with a call by putting the
comment in square brackets.  For example, the sequencer does not
accept Everybody Cross Run, so instead you can enter
Trade the Wave [ Everybody Cross Run ]

Multiple calls can be entered on one line by separating
them with semicolons.  This is just an input convenience,
the calls are separated to multiple lines in the sequence.
## Copy and Paste

You can transfer your sequences between a text file with Copy and Paste.

## Abbreviations

There is a built-in list of abbreviations.  You can edit this list
to change and add your own abbreviations. Abbreviations
cannot be a word used in real calls, and cannot include spaces.  Pressing
Return saves your abbreviation.  If your abbreviation is
highlighted red it is in error, either it has a space or is a duplicate.
To delete an abbreviation just clear it, don't forget to press
Return.  Press the Abbreviations button to re-sort
and remove blanks.
All the abbreviations are stored between sessions.
## Special Commands

- Undo - removes the most recent call
- Reset - clears the current sequence
- Color On/Off/Reset/Random - sets all dancer colors
- Color Dancer/Couple [n] [color] - assign a color to a dancer or
couple, same as changing the setting.
- Id None/Dancers/Couples/Names - Same as the Dancer Identification setting.

## What the Sequencer Can Do

There are two ways the sequencer figures out how to do a call:
 - It first looks for an exact match for the call and formation in the illustrated animations.  For calls like Star Thru genders must also match. - If an exact match is not found, it looks for code specific for that call which can compute the animation for any appropriate formation. This includes concept calls programmed to work together with other calls. 

Details on Specific Calls

- Basic 1
- Basic 2
- Mainstream
- Plus
- [A-1](sequencer-a1.html)
- A-2
- [C-1](sequencer-c1.html)
- [C-1](sequencer-c2.html)
- C-3A
- C-3B


Any call illustrated in Taminations can be used if the formation matches.
In addition, some simple calls and modifiers are programmed so they can be
used in any appropriate formation.  These include


- **Designators:** Boys/Girls, Beaus/Belles, Leaders/Trailers, Ends/Centers/Very Centers, Facing Dancers, Outer 2/4/6, Center 2/4/6  
Heads/Sides - in a squared set, refers to dancers in those positions.
Otherwise, the original heads or sides.  
Couples / Waves - dancers that are couples (facing the same direction),
or dancers in waves or mini-waves (facing opposite directions).  You can
also say "Dancers in Waves" or "Wave Dancers".

- **Calls:** Run/Cross Run, Face In/Out/Left/Right, Quarter In/Out,
Pass Thru, Slip, Slide Thru, Turn Back, Wheel Around, Zig/Zag
- **Modifiers and Concepts:** Roll, Spread


There are some special calls and keywords you can use:

- Adjust to (a) <formation> -
Shift the dancers to Tamination's standard for the given formation.
The dancers need to be reasonably close, it will only adjust a small amount.  
Formations you can adjust to are
Lines, Columns, Boxes, 1/4 Tag, Diamonds, Thar, Tidal Wave/Line, Hourglass,
Butterfly, O, Galaxy.  
Dancers can be facing forward or back, so 1/4 Tag
includes 3/4 Tag, Lines includes all Lines and Waves, and Columns and
Boxes are really the same (Boxes does not include T-Bones).

- Square the Set - all dancers go straight home
- Promenade Home - will work if partners are close and
dancers are in sequence.
- Swing Corner and Promenade - like Promenade Home.
- Promenade with Corner - no swing
- Back Away - use this after calls like Heads Right and Left Thru if you do not want the dancers to stay in the center
- Step Ahead
- Slide In/Out/Left/Right
- <anything> once and a half (or 1 1/2)
- Those Who Can - Several simple calls such as Pass Thru, Slide Thru, and Touch a Quarter can be prepended with Those Who Can
- <anything> twice
- Half <anything>

## What the Sequencer Cannot Do

Except for the simple programmed calls listed above, the sequencer can only
do calls that it can find in Taminations.  For example, it will not do
Dosado from waves because there's no animation for that.

The sequencer does not know much about Challenge concepts.  There
are several other programs that are much better at writing Challenge
choreography.
## This is a New Feature

Any and all [feedback](mailto:brad@bradchristie.com?Subject=Taminations%20sequencer) is appreciated.  You may find
things that don't work right.  Also feel free to let me know features you would
like added next.
