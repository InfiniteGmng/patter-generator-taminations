# Instructions

The basic operation of the sequencer is simple: 
type a call, press return, and watch the dancers perform it.
But to learn all the details requires a lot more information
than can be presented on one page.  So it's broken up into these topics.

## Contents

* [Entering Calls](entering_calls.md) - Details on the syntax
* [Copy and Paste](copy_and_paste.md) - This is how to save your work
* [Abbreviations](abbreviations.md) - Reduce common calls to just a few letters
* [Special Calls](special_calls.md) - To adjust the dancers to where you want them
* [Special Commands](special_commands.md) - Type in settings and other commands
* [Selecting Dancers](designators.md) - Boys/Girls, Leaders/Trailers, etc.
* [Calls with Parts and Other Modifications](modifications.md)
* [How it Works](how_it_works.md)
* Notes for Specific Calls
