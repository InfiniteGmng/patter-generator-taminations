# Abbreviations

There is a built-in list of abbreviations.  You can edit this list
to change and add your own abbreviations. Abbreviations
cannot be a word used in real calls, and cannot include spaces.  Pressing
Return saves your abbreviation.  If your abbreviation is
highlighted red it is in error, either it has a space or is a duplicate.
To delete an abbreviation just clear it, don't forget to press
Return.  All the abbreviations are stored between sessions.

You can sort your abbreviations by tapping on the headers of either column.

The Copy button puts all your abbreviations into the system clipboard as text.
Each abbreviation is one line, with the expansion separated by a tab.
You can then paste it into a text editor or spreadsheet program.

Paste does just the opposite - it expects to find a list of abbreviations in 
the system clipboard, which it then adds to your current abbreviations.
