# Abbreviations

There is a built-in list of abbreviations.  You can edit this list
to change and add your own abbreviations. Abbreviations
cannot be a word used in real calls, and cannot include spaces.  Pressing
Return saves your abbreviation.  If your abbreviation is
highlighted red it is in error, either it has a space or is a duplicate.
To delete an abbreviation just clear it, don't forget to press
Return.  Press the Abbreviations button to re-sort
and remove blanks.
All the abbreviations are stored between sessions.
