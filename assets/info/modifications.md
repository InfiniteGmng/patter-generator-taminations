# Modifications

## Calls with Parts
Many calls are divided into parts.  These calls are noted in the section for each dance level.
They can be modified in several ways.  In place of \<nth> you can use 1st, 2nd, .. or Last.

- **Do the \<nth> Part of \<call with parts>** - Pulls out just one part and performs it.
- **Finish \<call with parts>** - Same as Skip the 1st Part
- **Reverse Order \<call with parts>** - Do all the parts from last to first
- **\<call with parts> Skip the \<nth> Part** - Do all but that one part
- **\<call with parts> Replace the \<nth> Part With \<another call>**
- **\<call with parts> Interrupt (Before|After) the \<nth> Part With \<another call>** - This inserts \<another call> as an additional part to the call.
- **\<call with parts> Interrupt (Between|After) Each Part With \<another call>** - 
This inserts \<another call> between every part.  If **Interrupt After** is used, one more \<another call> is added at the end of the call.
- **\<call with parts> But \<another call>** - Some calls with parts have a specific part that can be replaced with just the magic word **But** followed by the replacement.  These are noted with the description of each call.
- **\<call with parts> Turn the Star (1/4|1/2|3/4|a full turn)** - Some calls have stars that are turned as one of the parts. The amount of turn can be adjusted.

## Other Ways Calls can be Modified

* **Those Who Can** - Several simple calls such as Pass Thru, Slide Thru, and Touch a Quarter can be prepended with Those Who Can.
* **Do Your Part** - 2 or 4 dancers do a 4 or 8 dancer call, ignoring the other dancers and dancing with phantoms instead.  Example: from waves Ends Do Your Part Hourglass Circulate.
- **Half \<anything>**; **\<anything> once and a half** (or 1 1/2, or 1.5) - of course, can only be used with calls that have an even number of parts.
- **\<anything> [Go] Twice** - Repeat the entire call.  Can be limited to specific dancers, as in **Circulate Boys Go Twice**
