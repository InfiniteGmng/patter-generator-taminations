# Details for Basic 1 Calls

- **Around to a Line** - The specific wording that works is **Around (1|2) To A Line**,
or **Around 1 And Come Into The Middle**.  Most common usage is from a squared set
(Heads|Sides) Separate Around ...
- **Circle (Left|Right)** - You can do these but not much afterwards.  The sequencer works best with dancers lined up with the walls, not so well with circles.
- **Promenade Home** - will work if partners are close and
  dancers are in sequence.
- **Swing Corner and Promenade** - like Promenade Home.
- **Promenade with Corner** - no swing
- **And a Quarter More** - can be used with calls that end with a Courtesy Turn, such as
Right and Left Thru or Ladies Chain
- **Right and Left Thru** - is a 2-part call
- **Square Thru** - it accepts **[Left] Square Thru \<n> [To a Wave]**, and also **[Left] Square Thru (on the <nth> Hand|on \<n>) \<anything>**.  If you use **To a Wave** it will mark the call as C-1 since that's a C-1 concept.
