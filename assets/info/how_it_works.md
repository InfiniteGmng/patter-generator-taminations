## What the Sequencer Can Do

There are two ways the sequencer figures out how to do a call:
- It first looks for an exact match for the call and formation in the illustrated animations.  For calls like Star Thru genders must also match. - If an exact match is not found, it looks for code specific for that call which can compute the animation for any appropriate formation. This includes concept calls programmed to work together with other calls.




Any call illustrated in Taminations can be used if the formation matches.
In addition, some simple calls and modifiers are programmed so they can be
used in any appropriate formation.  These include




## What the Sequencer Cannot Do

Except for the simple programmed calls listed above, the sequencer can only
do calls that it can find in Taminations.  For example, it will not do
Dosado from waves because there's no animation for that.

The sequencer does not know much about Challenge concepts.  There
are several other programs that are much better at writing Challenge
choreography.
