#  Special Calls

These are commands to move the dancers that aren't really square dance calls,
or aren't part of a specific program,
but are useful shortcuts or fixes.

- **Adjust to (a) \<formation>** -
  Shift the dancers to Tamination's standard for the given formation.
  The dancers need to be reasonably close, it will only adjust a small amount.  
  Formations you can adjust to are
  Lines, Columns, Boxes, 1/4 Tag, Diamonds, Thar, Tidal Wave/Line, Hourglass,
  Butterfly, O, Galaxy.  
  Dancers can be facing forward or back, so 1/4 Tag
  includes 3/4 Tag, Lines includes all Lines and Waves, and Columns and
  Boxes are really the same (Boxes does not include T-Bones).

- **Square the Set** - all dancers go straight home, from wherever they are.
- **Step / Step Ahead / Back Away / Backup** - Moves the dancers forward or back
- **Slide In/Out/Left/Right** - Moves the dancers sideways
- **Flip In/Out/Left/Right** - Like a Run around a phantom.  Same as Loop 1.
- **Face the Caller** - Designated dancers turn to face the bottom of the screen.
- **While** - Combines 2 calls to be done simultaneously by 2 groups of dancers.
You can use **While the Others** for the 2nd group to be all the dancers not in the
1st group.
