# Selecting Dancers

* **Boys/Girls**
* **Beaus/Belles** - follows the A-1 definition: dancers with partner on the right are Beaus, 
dancers with partner on the left are Belles
* **Leaders/Trailers** 
* **Ends/Centers/Very Centers** - follows the Callerlab definition, including that for tidal formations.
* **Facing Dancers**
* **Outer 2/4/6, Center 2/4/6** - according to distance from the center of the set.  
  Note that for tidal formations, Centers is not the same as Center 4.
* **Center / Middle / Outside Diamond** - Selects specified diamond from formations with
  a wave or line of 6.  Center and Outside Diamond can also be used with thars.
* **Heads/Sides** - in a squared set, refers to dancers in those positions.
Otherwise, the original heads or sides.
* **Couples / Waves** - dancers that are couples (facing the same direction),
  or dancers in waves or mini-waves (facing opposite directions).  You can
  also say "Dancers in Waves" or "Wave Dancers".
* **Center Wave of 4** - useful for less common formations like concentric diamonds
* **Wave of 6**
