# Entering Calls

Enter calls by typing into the edit box at the upper left.
Case is not important.  The sequencer recognizes common
synonyms, such as 2/two, through/thru, and will adjust
plurals as needed.  Calls are not case-sensitive.


Erase the last call with the Undo button or by typing "undo".
To erase the current sequence and start a new one, tap the
Reset button or type "reset".

To add a comment, just type a line starting with anything
except a letter or number.

You can also insert comments with a call by putting the
comment in square brackets.  For example, the sequencer does not
accept Everybody Cross Run, so instead you can enter
Trade the Wave [ Everybody Cross Run ]

Multiple calls can be entered on one line by separating
them with semicolons.  This is just an input convenience,
the calls are separated to multiple lines in the sequence.
