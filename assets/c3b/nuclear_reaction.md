# Nuclear Reaction

From a Generalized 1/4 Tag in which the Very Centers are directly facing an outside dancer.

1. Very Centers and directly-facing outside dancers Pass Thru; 
1. Center 4 Cast Off 1/4 and Roll and Spread to become Ends of Lines as the Others Cross Concentric Vertical 1/2 Tag; 
1. all Counter Rotate 1/4.

Ends in Parallel Lines. This is a 3-part call.

**Cross Nuclear Reaction** Same as Nuclear Reaction except that the Very
Centers Diagonal Pass Thru with the diagonally-facing outside dancers.
