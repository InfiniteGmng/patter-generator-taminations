# Quadruple *formation* Concept


Quadruple *formations* consist of four adjacent *formation* some of which
may have positions occupied by phantoms. The given *formation* is
usually a 4-dancer formation such as a Box, Column, Diamond, Line, or
Wave. Work with the dancers and phantoms within your formation. Keep
track of the phantoms and allow spaces for them upon completion of the
call. When *formation* is a 4-dancer formation, there should be a total
of 16 dancer | phantom positions before and after each call.
