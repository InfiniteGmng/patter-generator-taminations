# Rotate

Rotates (Rotate, Reverse Rotate, Single Rotate, and Reverse Single Rotate)
are listed on different challenge lists according to the starting formation.

At C1,  
Rotates can only be called from a Generalized Squared Set, or from similar formations (e.g., from Columns, the Ends only).

At C2,  
Rotates can also be called from Parallel Lines or from a 2 x 2 (e.g., In Your Block Single Rotate 1/4).

At C3B,  
Rotates can also be called from Columns.

## Procedure for dancing Rotates:
0. Identify the center point of your setup. The center point of your setup is the very center point of the square (commonly called the "flagpole center") except in the following cases:
    * If you are in a 2 x 4 formation and are in Lines, the center point is the Center of each Box (i.e., work Split). If you are in a 2 x 4 T-Bone, the center point for the Column dancers is the flagpole center, whereas the Line dancers are working Split.
    * If Rotate is preceded by the term **Split**,
then divide your formation into two equal subformations.
The center point is the Center of your subformation.
From a 2 x 4, Split means to divide the setup into two 2 x 2s,
not two 1 x 4s.
    * If Rotate is preceded by the name of a formation in which to work,
the center point is the Center of that formation. For example,
from Columns consider 'Each Column Single Rotate 1/4'.
In this case, the center point is the Center of the 1 x 4 setup.
1. Turn 1/4  **relative to that center point** according to the following rules:

| Rotate                | As Couples 1/4 To Promenade           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Reverse Rotate        | As Couples 1/4 To Reverse Promenade   |
| Single Rotate         | Individually 1/4 To Promenade         |
| Reverse Single Rotate | Individually 1/4 To Reverse Promenade |

- **1/4 To Promenade**  
Turn 1/4 so that your left shoulder is toward the Center of your formation.

- **1/4 To Reverse Promenade**
Turn 1/4 so that your right shoulder is toward the Center of your formation.

2. [Counter Rotate](../c1/counter_rotate.md)
the given fraction around that center point.
From a Squared Set, active dancers work around the outside of the set. The inactive dancers should move into the center of the set.
