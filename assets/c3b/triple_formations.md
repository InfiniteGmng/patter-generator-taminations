# Triple *formations* Working *direction* Concept

**Triple _formations_ Working _direction_**
is a precise way to state how to do some 12-Matrix calls.

This concept allows for 8-dancer calls to be done from
Triple *formations* such as
Triple Boxes | Columns | Diamonds | Lines | Waves.
Normally from these formations we are limited to
4-dancer (or fewer) calls, since each sub-formation
(Box, Column, Diamond, Line, or Wave) contains only four spots.

On **Triple _formations_ Working _direction_**,
each dancer selects a subset of eight (out of 12) spots in which to work.
The dancers within the outside Triple formations must always select
to work within the four spots in their Triple *formation*
and the four spots in the center Triple *formation*.
The dancers in the center Triple *formation* work with the four spots
in their Triple *formation* and the four spots in the outside
Triple *formation* which is toward the given *direction*.
If the *direction* is **forward**,
the Center dancers work with the outside
Triple formation which they are **facing**.
If the *direction* is **backward**,
they work with the outside Triple formation which is **behind** them.
If the *direction* is **Right**
(or **Left**), they work with the outside Triple formation
which is toward their **Right** (or **Left**).
If the *direction* is **Together**, they work with the outside
Triple formation that is closest to them.
If the *direction* is **Apart**,
they work with the Triple formation that is furthest from them.
