# Trapezoid Formation

A Trapezoid is a Distorted 2 x 2 that can be formed
from a normal 2 x 2 after any two adjacent dancers
each move a distance of one matrix position directly away from each other.

From a 2 x 4, there are two Trapezoids.
The Ends of one side work with the Centers of the other side within a Distorted Box.
