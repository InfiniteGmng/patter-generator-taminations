# Cross Cycle

**From a Two-Faced Line**:

1. ***Centers Cross Fold and all adjust to a Box*** ([Bounce The Centers](../c2/bounce.md)); 
2. ***Box Counter Rotate 1/4***;
3. ***Roll***. 

Ends in Facing Couples.

This is a 3-part call, and Callers often call **2/3 Cross Cycle**.

**From an applicable 2 x 2** (e.g, Facing Couples or Mini-Wave Box):

As one movement, (Facing or Box) Recycle & Slither.

Ends in a Two-Faced Line.
