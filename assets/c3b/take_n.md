# Take {n}

From Back-to-Back Lines.

The n dancers on the right-hand side of each Line do a
'[Shakedown](../c1/shakedown.md)' movement
(1/4 Right, [Counter Rotate 1/4](../c1/counter_rotate.md), and Roll)
and adjust to end in Concentric Facing Lines of n
as the others 1/4 Right and Step Ahead to join hands
creating a compact symmetric formation.
