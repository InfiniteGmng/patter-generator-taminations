# Boomerang

From Tandem Couples, a Mini-Wave Box or the 2 x 2
T-Bone obtained from a Mini-Wave Box after Leaders 1/4 Out. 

There are two slightly different definitions of **Boomerang** depending upon
the starting formation.

1. **From Tandem Couples**: Leaders Zoom as Trailers Circulate and Trade.  Ends in Facing Couples.  
2. **From a Mini-Wave Box or other applicable 2 x 2 formations**: Leaders Zoom as Trailers Scoot Back (Extend, Trade, and Extend).  A Mini-Wave Box ends in a Mini-Wave Box.  This use of Boomerang can be fractionalized into halves.
