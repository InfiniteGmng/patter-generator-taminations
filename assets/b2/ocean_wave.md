# Ocean Wave Family

The Ocean Wave Family groups together two of the simplest calls
that relate to the formations of Mini-Waves, Ocean Waves, and Tidal Waves.

Note: "Ocean Wave" refers to a 4-dancer formation.
See "Appendix A: Formations: 4-Dancer Formations".
Terms such as "Wave of 3" or "Wave of 6" must be used for similar formations
with other numbers of dancers.

## Step to a Wave

### Starting formations

### Command examples

#### Step To A Wave
#### Step To An Ocean Wave
#### Make a Wave

### Dance action

### Styling

Dancers should finish using Hands Up position
with all adjacent dancers.
(See "Additional Detail: Styling: Arms and Hands";
however, also see "General: Standardization".)

### Comments

Usually Step To A Wave is called from Facing Couples, ending in a Right-Hand Ocean Wave.

Dancers can also be asked to step to a left-hand wave (e.g., Step To A Left-Hand Wave).

The Ocean Wave Rule does not apply to this call.

The Facing Couples Rule requires certain dancers to add Step To A Wave prior to some calls. 
See General: Conventions and Rules: Facing Couples Rule.
