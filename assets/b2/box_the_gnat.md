### Dance action

Dancers join and raise their right hands to make an arch; these hands remain
connected throughout the call. In one smooth motion dancers Pass Thru and turn around:

- The woman turns left and goes under the arch.
- The man turns right and walks forward around the woman.

At the end of the call, each dancer will be standing in the otherâ€™s original
position and they will again be facing.

### Styling

The initial handhold in this call is like a handshake but less connected
than palm-to-palm. Throughout the call the dancers smoothly adjust this
connection so that they end with the same handhold. Hands should slide
over one another easily while still providing some degree of security and stabilization.

### Comments

The right hands are still joined at the completion of the action,
and often the next call will begin with the joined right hands.

The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call. From a Mini-Wave,
dancers smoothly adjust handholds into the one described above.
Depending on the handhold used in waves (which can vary regionally),
this may require dancers initially to back up slightly.
