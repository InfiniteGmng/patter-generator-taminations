# Wheel and Deal Family

### Starting formations

Two-Faced Line, One-Faced Line

### Command example

#### Wheel And Deal

### Dance action

Each couple works as a unit. Wheel and Deal is danced as one smooth motion, 
even though the descriptions below break the motion into two parts.

From a Two-Faced Line: Each couple steps forward and then
wheels 180 degrees toward the center of the line, 
with the original center dancers acting as the pivots about which the couples turn. 
Couples end facing each other.

From a One-Faced Line: The couple on the left steps forward. 
Then each couple wheels 180 degrees toward the center of the original line,
with the original center dancers acting as the pivots about which the couples turn.
The couple that started on the right ends in front of the other couple.

### Ending formations

From a Two-Faced Line, Facing Couples. From a One-Faced Line, Tandem Couples.

### Timing

4

### Styling

Use couple handholds. Original center dancers should use the joined handhold 
to guide the original end dancers to circle around them.

### Comments

To assist in understanding this call, here are some helpful facts:
 
- Dancers turn toward the center of the line (like Bend the Line, but unlike Wheel Around, which is always toward the left)
- Each couple ends facing the opposite direction from which they started
- From a One-Faced Line
- The couple on the right ends in front
- The couples pass right shoulders (of the right-hand dancers)

From a One-Faced Line, a more accurate dance action for the couple on the right
would be to step forward after the turn. So from a Tidal Line, Wheel And Deal ends
in Two-Faced Lines. Because of square breathing
(see "Additional Detail: Dance Action: Square Breathing"),
this step forward for Wheel And Deal is even more pronounced from
Lines Facing In, but unnecessary from Lines Facing Out.
