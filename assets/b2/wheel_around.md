The pivot point is the handhold between the two dancers.

### Styling

Dancers use a couple handhold or maintain
the handhold from the previous call (e.g., Promenade).
They adjust the handhold as they finish Wheel Around
if required by the next call.

### Comments

When four couples are promenading and two couples Wheel
Around, extra action is required. For example, in "Promenade, Keep
Walking; Heads Wheel Around", the Sides stop promenading while the
Heads Wheel Around, and all adjust to Facing Lines. Some callers
teach that Sides stop promenading when facing Head or Side walls
so that the final formation faces those walls squarely without
further adjustment.

See "General: Ways Of Naming Dancers: Heads / Sides" for more
details about naming dancers to Wheel Around from a promenade.
