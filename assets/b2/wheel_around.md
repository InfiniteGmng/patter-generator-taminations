### Dance action

The couple, working as a unit, turns around to the left (180 degrees).
The left-side dancer backs up while the right-side dancer moves forward.
The pivot point is the handhold between the two dancers.

### Ending formation

Couple

### Timing

4

### Styling

Dancers use a couple handhold or maintain
the handhold from the previous call (e.g., Promenade).
They adjust the handhold as they finish Wheel Around
if required by the next call.

### Comments

When four couples are promenading and two couples Wheel
Around, extra action is required. For example, in "Promenade, Keep
Walking; Heads Wheel Around", the Sides stop promenading while the
Heads Wheel Around, and all adjust to Facing Lines. Some callers
teach that Sides stop promenading when facing Head or Side walls
so that the final formation faces those walls squarely without
further adjustment.

See "Preface: Ways Of Naming Dancers: Heads / Sides" for more
details about naming dancers to Wheel Around from a promenade.

The variation of this call in which dancers turn in the other
direction is called Reverse Wheel Around. See "Additional Detail:
Commands: Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around".

### Calling Tip

Wheel Around can be easier and more successful for the dancers if the
preceding call produces appropriate body flow.

### Teaching Tip

Wheel Around is like a Courtesy Turn without using the Courtesy Turn handhold.
