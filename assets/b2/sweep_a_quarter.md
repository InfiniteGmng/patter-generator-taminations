# Sweep a Quarter

Sweep a Quarter is a suffix call. That is, its action depends on the preceding call.

### Starting formation

Facing Couples only

### Command examples:

#### Flutterwheel and Sweep a Quarter
#### Couples Circulate, Wheel and Deal and Sweep One Quarter
#### Recycle, Sweep a Quarter
#### Ferris Wheel, Centers Sweep a Quarter

### Dance action

Circle Right or Left 1/4 (#1.b), except that each couple does not join hands with the couple they are
facing. The circling direction continues the motion that completed the previous call.

### Ending formation

Facing Couples

### Timing

2

### Styling

Dancers use a couple handhold.

### Comments

As the previous call ends, each dancer's motion around the center of the forming Facing Couples must
be the same (either clockwise or counterclockwise). Sweep a Quarter is improper after Chain Down the Line
because of the dancers that start in the center. 
At the end of the call, their turning motion is not around, nor
approximately around, the center point of the forming Facing Couples. 
Similarly, it is improper to call Sweep a
Quarter after Bend the Line, Wheel Around, Cast Off 3/4, etc.

From a Wave, Recycle and Sweep a Quarter is proper. This is an exception made because of years of use. The
exception is needed because in the definition of Recycle, the last part for some dancers (those dancers who
began in the center) is a turn in place.

After Ferris Wheel (or Wheel and Deal from Lines Facing Out), "Sweep a Quarter" is improper, but "Centers
Sweep a Quarter" is proper. Some callers use “Ferris Wheel and Outsides do a big Sweep a Quarter; You’re
Home" as a gimmick (see "Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks").

"Sweep a Quarter Twice" is an uncommon phrasing. A caller is more likely to say "Sweep a Quarter, Sweep
Another Quarter", "Sweep a Quarter, Sweep a Quarter More", "Sweep Two Quarters", or "Sweep One Half".
Caution must be used when calling to groups for whom English is not their native language.
