## Trade

### Starting formations

Mini-Wave, Couple, and non-adjacent dancers, as described below

### Command examples

#### Centers Trade
#### Boys Trade
#### Ends Trade
#### Heads Square Thru 4, Touch 1/4, Girls Trade
#### Center 6, Trade

### Dance action
 
Two dancers exchange places by walking forward in
a semicircle, passing right shoulders if they start facing the same
direction. (See "General: Conventions and Rules: Passing Rule".)
Dancers end facing the opposite direction from their original facing
directions.

### Ending formations

Mini-Wave, Couple, and non-adjacent dancers,
as described below

### Timing

Mini-Wave, 3; Couple, 4; with additional beats for
non-adjacent dancers

### Styling

From a Mini-Wave, dancers maintain their handhold.

From a Couple, dancers swing their joined hands backward
slightly as they release their handhold. This gets them turning in
the correct direction as they start moving forward.

### Comments

Two dancers may Trade only when they are facing the same or
opposite directions. Additionally, each dancer must be directly to
the right or left of the other, but they do not need to be adjacent.

Trade, when used without designating dancers, means Everyone
Trade.

Callers sometimes use helping words with this call. For
example, from normal Facing Lines, "Pass Thru, Girls Trade down the
line" alerts the women that they are not adjacent. Another example
is "Trade by the Right" (or Left), which indicates that each pair of
dancers who Trade are in a Right-Hand (or Left-Hand) Mini-Wave. In
certain cases, helping words are necessary to designate pairs (e.g.,
from an Alamo Ring, Trade by the Right) or designate dancers (e.g.,
from an Inverted Line, Those Who Can Trade by the Left). Callers
should be aware that sometimes (principally outside English-speaking
countries) dancers may mistake "Trade by the Right" for the call
Trade By (#49). In such a situation, "Trade with the right hand" may
be more successful.

For this call, when there are exactly four dancers who are
directly right or left of one another, e.g., Heads Pass the Ocean,
Extend, Everyone Trade, then the dance action is completed
separately by each outside dancer with the nearby inside dancer.
Similarly, if six or eight dancers Trade who are directly right or
left of one another, then pairs of dancers Trade, where the pairs
are determined working from the outside toward the center. For
example, consider Heads Lead Right, Pass the Ocean, Girls Trade,
Boys Trade. In each Trade, dancers are paired on each side. Helping
words can also make this clear, e.g., "Each Side, Boys Trade". Also
see "General: Ways of Naming Dancers: Centers / Ends".

## Partner Trade

### Starting formation

Couple only

### Command examples

#### Partner Trade
#### Double Pass Thru; Leaders Partner Trade
#### Boys Partner Trade

### Dance action

Trade

### Ending formation

Couple

### Timing

4

### Styling

Dancers swing their joined hands backward slightly as
they release their handhold. This gets them turning in the correct
direction as they start moving forward.

### Comments

It is common to use Partner Trade rather than Trade for a
Couple, but both have the same effect. Using Partner Trade helps
dancers anticipate passing right shoulders.

Partner Trade is improper when the dancers are not adjacent.

In 2017, the Mainstream Committee voted to restrict Partner
Trade to start from a Couple only.

## Couples Trade

### Starting formations

Two-Faced Line, One-Faced Line, and
non-adjacent Couples as described below

### Command examples

#### Couples Trade
#### Center 4, Couples Trade
#### Center Couples Trade
#### Outside 4, Couples Trade

### Dance action

Couples, each working as a unit, Trade.

### Ending formations

Two-Faced Line, One-Faced Line, and
non-adjacent Couples as described below

### Timing

Two-Faced Line, 6; One-Faced Line, 8; with additional
beats for non-adjacent Couples

### Styling

Each couple maintains their handhold. From a Two-Faced
Line, center dancers also maintain their handhold.

### Comments

Two Couples may Trade only when they are facing the same or
opposite directions. Additionally, each Couple must be directly to
the right or left of the other, but they do not need to be adjacent.
If there are four Couples that are directly right or left of one
another, then the dance action is completed separately by each
outside Couple with the nearby inside Couple.

Callers may use helping words, e.g. "Couples Trade by the
right". See the comments for Trade.
