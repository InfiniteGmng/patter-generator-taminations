Hands Up (see Additional Detail: Styling: Arms and Hands). 
When called from Facing Couples, the four dancers do not make a Wave midway through Touch 1/4.

From Facing Dancers, the call [Step To A Wave](ocean_wave.md) gives a Right-Hand Mini-Wave.

The Ocean Wave Rule does not apply to this call. Therefore, a combination like
"Swing Thru, All 8 Circulate, Touch 1/4" is improper.

The left-handed version of this call is Left Touch 1/4. See "Additional Detail: Commands: Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around".
