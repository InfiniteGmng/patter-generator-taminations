### Starting formation

Two-Faced Lines

### Command examples

#### Ferris Wheel
#### Ride A Ferris Wheel

Each Couple Steps Forward. Out-facing couples do their part, Wheel And Deal. In-facing
Couples form a momentary Two-Faced Line in the center, and without stopping Wheel And Deal.

### Ending formation

Double Pass Thru

### Timing

6

### Styling

All dancers use couple handholds. The in-facing couples should walk forward enough that they
could form a Two-Faced Line in the center before starting their Wheel And Deal. The dance action
should be a forward and wheeling action, not a bending and sweeping action.

It is not necessary for the couples to touch adjacent hands
in the momentary two-faced line, but some
popular styling variations do involve touching or slapping hands.

The timing works best if the out-facing couple adjusts their speed
so that everyone finishes at the same
time.

### Comments

As originally defined, there were other starting formations
for Ferris Wheel (Facing Lines, 1/4 Line),
but those variations have never been part of the CALLERLAB program.

From the formation Two-Faced Lines plus the couple looking in Bend The Line,
the call Ferris Wheel is proper.
This application is uncommon. Each Couple does their part.

The phrase "Ferris Wheel And Deal" is improper.
