# Flutterwheel Family

### Starting formation

Facing Couples

### Command examples

#### Flutterwheel
#### Reverse Flutterwheel
#### Reverse The Flutter

### Dance action

The right-side dancers leave their current partner and Right Arm Turn with each other a full turn,
each ending where they started. Halfway through this motion,
they take a couple handhold with the other dancer
(i.e., the one they were originally facing directly),
and the second half of the Arm Turn is completed with each new couple working as a unit.

For Reverse Flutterwheel, use the same dance action,
except that the left-side dancers Left Arm Turn.

### Ending formation

Facing Couples

### Timing

8 (SS All four ladies, 12 steps.)

### Styling

Each dancer who is on the outside blends smoothly into a new couple
by turning slightly to become adjacent to the approaching dancer
and reaching out to create a couple handhold. Some dancers begin moving forward
beforehand contact is made and then walk slightly ahead of their new partner
so that the overall motion is smoother.

When the outside dancers are women, they may use skirt work with their free hand.

### Comments

In the call Ladies Lead, Flutterwheel, the extra words do not change the
dance action and are intended to be helpful. However, in some areas they may cause
confusion because dancers will anticipate Ladies Lead Dixie Style To A Wave.
