# Run / Cross Run

With these calls, the caller must designate certain
dancers; generally half the dancers are designated. For this
definition, a runner (or cross-runner) is a designated dancer
and a non-runner is another dancer who moves during the call.
For example, in Boys Run, the men are the runners and the women
are the non-runners.

On Run, dancers work in pairs. On Cross Run, dancers work
in groups of four, with the cross-runners crossing the center of
the formation.

## Case 1: Run

### Starting formation

Mini-Wave, Couple

### Command examples

#### Boys Run
#### Centers Run
#### Women Run Right
#### Leaders Run

### Dance action

 Each runner (designated dancer) must have a non-runner either to the right or to the left,
and these dancers work together.

The runner and non-runner exchange places: the runner walks forward in a semicircle
into the non-runner's spot (ending with the opposite facing direction), while the non-runner
moves into the runner's spot without changing facing direction.

### Ending formation

Couple, Mini-Wave

### Timing

4

### Styling

Hands should blend into the handhold required for the ending formation
(i.e., Couple or Mini-Wave).

### Comments

A direction may be given, and this indicates where the
non-runner is relative to the runner. It is often optional
(e.g., Swing Thru, Boys Run Right), but may be required to
avoid ambiguity (e.g., from an Alamo or Circle; or Heads
Square Thru, Touch 1/4, Center Girls Run Left).

Infrequently used applications of Run can ask the same
designated dancers to run around successive people (e.g., End
Boy Run Right, Left, and Right), or to remain designated for
multiple calls (e.g., Girls Cross Run and then Run).

An extended application designates more than one
non-runner for each runner. E.g., from normal Lines Facing
Out, End Boys Run Around 2. In this case, the center dancers
are non-runners. The end boy walks in a semicircle to end in
the position of the farther center while each non-runner moves
one position toward where the runner started.

Some callers occasionally use Everyone Run. For example,
from Lines Facing Out, this would be equivalent to Partner
Trade. Because each runner is not next to a non-runner, this
application is a gimmick (see Additional Detail: Commands:
Gimmicks). This gimmick may not be used if only some dancers
are designated. For example, after Heads Pass the Ocean,
Extend, Split Circulate, the call Boys Run is improper because
it is unclear if the Girls should do the part of the
non-runner or not move at all. To be proper, the caller could
use Do Your Part (see Additional Detail: Commands: Do Your
Part).

At Basic, the runner and non-runner will almost
always begin as a Mini-Wave or Couple. A workshop should
precede other applications, such as when the non-runner is
initially facing the shoulder of the runner (e.g., from a
Double Pass Thru formation, Centers Square Thru 4, Centers
Run).

## Case 2: Cross Run

### Starting formation

General Line

### Command examples

#### Girls Cross Run
#### Centers Cross Run
#### On Each Side, Centers Cross Run (from a Tidal Wave)
#### In the Center Wave, Centers Cross Run (from a Tidal Wave)
#### Ends Cross Run

### Dance action

Dancers work in a 1x4 Formation, where the cross-runners (designated dancers)
must both be centers or both be ends. The others are the non-runners.

The cross-runners walk forward in a semi-circle into the spot vacated by the
farther non-runner (ending with the opposite facing direction). That is, each cross-runner
will cross the center of the four-dancer formation.

Simultaneously each non-runner moves into the spot of the closer cross-runner
without changing facing direction. This position will be on their half of the four-dancer formation.
That is, a center non-runner moves into the nearer end position; an end non-runner moves
into the nearer center position.

### Ending formation

General Line

### Timing

4

### Styling

Hands should blend into the handhold required for the ending formation (i.e., Couple or Mini-Wave).

### Comments
 
From a Tidal Wave (or other 1x8 Formations),
callers must carefully identify centers and ends. See the Tidal Wave command examples above and "General: Ways Of Naming Dancers: Centers / Ends".

If the cross-runners are centers facing the same way, they Half Sashay,
blending into a Run around the original far end.

If the cross-runners are ends facing the same way, they pass right shoulders with each other.

From a General Line, Everyone Cross Run is a gimmick.
See the second to last comment of Run, above.

At Basic, Cross Run will almost always be called from a General Line.
For other applications, see the final comment of Run, above.
