### Comments

The Facing Couples Rule applies to these calls.

From a Tidal Wave, Swing Thru is danced in the Ocean Wave
on each half; no dancers cross the center of the Tidal Wave.

After applying the Facing Couples Rule, the starting
formation of Swing Thru must be a Wave or an Alamo Ring
(except for the extended application below). It is improper,
for example, to Swing Thru from an Inverted Line.

As an extended application, dancers can work in other
groups, provided that after applying the Facing Couples Rule
they are in a wave of three or more dancers. In this case, the
caller must clearly tell those dancers to work together. For
example, Heads Pass The Ocean; Extend; Boys Circulate 1 1/2;
Girls Cast Off 3/4; In the Wave of 6, Swing Thru. To have
eight dancers work together is especially tricky, and should
be used only with great caution, since normally eight dancers
work in two groups of four. The eight-dancer application is
usually reserved for dance programs in which a different call
[[Grand Swing Thru](../plus/grand_swing_thru.md)]
achieves this action.
