<h2>Spin Chain the Gears</h2>
<p>Starting formation: Ocean Waves. </p>
<p>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears1">Each end and the adjacent center Turn 1/2.</span>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears2">New centers Turn 3/4 to form a center Ocean Wave
and the ends Flip In (180 degree inward turn similar to Ends Run). </span>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears3">Very Centers Turn 1/2. </span>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears4">Each half of the square forms a four-hand Star (a “gear”)
  and turns it 3/4.</span>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears5">Very Centers Turn 1/2</span>
<span id="SpinChaintheGears6"> Those in the center Ocean Wave Turn 3/4
  while the other four dancers Flip Out
  (180 degree outward turn similar to Centers Run).</span>
  The call ends in waves with the same handedness and in
  the same location as the original waves.
</p>
  <p class="styling">STYLING: Ocean wave and star turns use standard styling.</p>
  <p>As the Centers Turn 3/4 at the beginning of the call,
  the other dancers pause slightly and then,
  as they Flip In, they bring the other hand up to immediately join the forming star.
</p>
<p class="timing">TIMING: 24</p>

<p class="comments">COMMENTS: The Facing Couples Rule applies to this call.</p>
  <p>The 3/4 fraction to turn the star can be modified by the caller,
  in which case different dancers
  will be the Very Centers for the Turn 1/2.
