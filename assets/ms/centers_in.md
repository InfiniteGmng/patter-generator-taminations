# Centers In

### Starting formation

Completed Double Pass Thru, Eight Chain Thru. More generally, a Couple with their
backs to the center of the set, each center dancer directly looking at an outside dancer.

### Command examples

#### Centers In
#### Put Centers In

### Dance action

Without changing facing direction, the outside dancers step away from each other to make
room for the center dancers, who step forward to end between them.

### Ending formation

Various. From Completed Double Pass Thru, Lines Facing Out. From Eight Chain
Thru, Inverted Lines with Ends Facing.

### Timing

2

### Styling

As center dancers step between the outside dancers they take hands with them, as appropriate
(couple handhold if facing the same direction or Ocean Wave styling if facing opposite directions).

### Comment

While Centers In appears to create extra space in the center, either the next call or square
breathing (see "Additional Detail: Dance Action: Square Breathing") will reduce or eliminate
that space.
