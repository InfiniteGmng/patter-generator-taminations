### Styling

Same as Right And Left Thru. Dancers doing the Left Pull By in the center move slowly so their action takes the same time as the Courtesy Turn on the outside.

Each part of this call ends in an Eight Chain Thru or Trade By formation. Dancers should not drift into a circular formation as in Wrong Way Grand.

### Comments

The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this call.

At Mainstream, Courtesy Turn (#15) is restricted to a man turning a woman. Therefore, at Mainstream, Eight Chain Thru is improper after Heads Square Thru 4, Sides Half Sashay. However, Eight Chain 3 would be proper.
