### Comments

The Facing Couples Rule applies to this call.

The combination "Spin The Top, Right and Left Thru"
must be delivered so that dancers adjust their
hands as necessary for the Right and Left Thru instead of first finishing the Spin The Top in a
hands-up Ocean Wave.

When Spin The Top is used from an Ocean Wave of 3 dancers, the caller must specify who starts (e.g.,
Right Spin The Top, Starting With The Right Spin The Top, Boys Start Spin The Top). The designated
dancers Turn 1/2. The non-designated dancer and the new center dancer Turn 3/4 while the other
dancer moves up around the outside of the formation to end in a new Ocean Wave of 3 dancers. This
usage is uncommon.

From a Left-Hand Ocean Wave, the phrase "Left Spin The Top" is acceptable.
"Left" is a helping word
(see "Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands: Extra words").

From a Right-Hand Ocean Wave, the phrases "Left Spin The Top" and
"Centers Start, Spin The Top" are improper.
