### Comments

The [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) applies to this call.

While the new centers are finishing the call, the resulting ends may be given another call (e.g., Spin Chain
Thru; Ends Circulate Twice).

Spin Chain Thru can be danced as "All Turn 1/2.
Those who meet Turn 3/4. Those who meet Turn 1/2. Those
who meet Turn 3/4".
With this in mind, some callers use Spin Chain Thru
from an Alamo Ring as a gimmick
(see "Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks").
When using this gimmick, callers must indicate which pairs
of dancers begin the call, e.g.,
"Start with the Right and Spin Chain Thru."
