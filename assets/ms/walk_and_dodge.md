# Walk and Dodge

### Starting formations

Box Circulate, Facing Couples

### Command Examples

#### Walk and Dodge
#### Right and Left Thru, Girls Walk, Boys Dodge (from a normal couple)

### Dance Action

Some dancers move forward ("walk") to take the position of the dancer in front of them, and other dancers,
without changing facing direction, move sideways ("dodge") into the adjacent spot.

From a Box Circulate, trailers "walk" and leaders "dodge".

From Facing Couples, callers must designate which dancers "walk" and which dancers "dodge".

### Ending Formation

Back-To-Back Couples, Box Circulate

### Timing

4

### Styling

Arms in natural dance position, with dancers forming a couple or
mini-wave handhold at the end of the call.

### Comments

Walk and Dodge is a four-dancer call.
From Columns, dancers work in two groups of four,
one on each side, ending in a Trade By formation.

As a gimmick, callers may designate some dancers
to back up rather than "walking". For example,
Heads Square Thru, Touch 1/4, Walk and Dodge,
Girls Back Up and Boys Dodge. From Lines Facing Out,
the command Centers Walk, Ends Dodge is also a gimmick,
as are other applications where dancers leave their group of four.
See "Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks".

There are extended applications in which six or eight dancers
work together. For example, after Sides Pass the Ocean,
Sides Swing thru, All Boys Run, it is possible to either have
the Center 6 Walk and Dodge or the Outside 6 Walk and Dodge.
In both cases, four dancers "walk" and two dancers "dodge".
It is also possible to have six dancers "walk" and two dancers "dodge".
For example, Heads Touch 1/4, Side Girls Dodge and Others Walk.

From Facing Couples or Back-to-Back Couples, the command
"Walk and Dodge" by itself is improper unless dancers are
expected to do their part (see Additional Detail: Commands: Do Your Part).
