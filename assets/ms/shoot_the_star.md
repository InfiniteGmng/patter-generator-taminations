### Styling

A forearm hold is used for the Arm
Turn. Other hands are in natural dance position and available for the
next call. Women can continue to use skirt work during the Arm Turn.

### Comment

The Facing Couples Rule does not apply to this call.

After Shoot the Star, the caller sometimes indicates that
dancers are to Pull By one or more times and Arm Turn into another
Thar. For instance, in the second command example above, following
the Step Thru the dancers Right Pull By and, stepping up to a left
forearm hold, Left Arm Turn 1/2.

The caller can direct the dancers to Go Forward any number of
hands. Each hand is a Pull By, except the last hand, which is
normally the start of an Arm Turn into a Thar or Wrong Way Thar.

Some callers use "Forward" to mean "in normal Right and Left
Grand direction" and use "Backward" (or "Back" or "Backwards") to
mean the opposite direction. Other callers use "Forward" to mean "the
direction you are facing" and never use the words "Back" or
"Backward". Either is acceptable, but callers must be careful not to
confuse dancers. See the fourth and fifth command examples above.

Some callers adapt Shoot the Star as a way to Cast Off 3/4 and
get an Alamo Ring, e.g., "Shoot The Star 3/4 To An Alamo Ring" or
simply "Shoot The Star To An Alamo Ring". Shoot the Star can also
blend into the next call, e.g., "Shoot The Star, 4 Ladies Chain."
