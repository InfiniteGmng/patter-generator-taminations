### Styling

From Facing Couples, the left-hand dancers take a full step back and to the right. This prepares for the Left Touch 1/4 while giving the right-hand dancers room to Right Pull By.

From Facing Tandems, the trailers step slightly to the right to prepare for the Left Touch 1/4.

### Comments

The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this call (from a Single 1/4 Tag).

From a Double Pass Thru, it is confusing to simply call Dixie Style to an Ocean Wave because of the following ambiguity: The center 4 could do the call starting from Facing Couples, or each Tandem could do the call with the Tandem they are facing. The caller should clarify by using extra words like:
- Center 4, Dixie Style to a Wave, or
- On a Double Track (or "Single File" or "Each Column of 4"), Dixie Style to a Wave.

"Double Track" is used to describe two side-by-side Facing Tandems; some callers avoid this terminology when the Facing Tandems are end-to-end (i.e., a 1x8 formation with Facing Tandems on each side). Also see "Part 4: Additional Detail: Starting Formations".

From a normal Squared Set, "All 4 Ladies Lead, Dixie Style to a Wave" is an extended application (and is likely to come after Four Ladies Chain). The Right Pull By is replaced by Right-Hand Star 1/2, similar to Four Ladies Chain. After the Left Touch 1/4, dancers end in a Thar with men in the center. Callers should expect to workshop this application.
