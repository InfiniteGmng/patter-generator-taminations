# Thar Family

In the Thar Family, Thars and Wrong Way Thars are formations in
motion. Center dancers hold a Pack-saddle Star (see "Additional
Detail: Styling") and walk backward, and each center dancer
maintains a forearm grip with the adjacent outside dancer, who walks
forward.

The calls in the Thar Family are some of the oldest. They are
traditionally delivered in a more verbose fashion, blurring the
division between the actual command words and the helping words. As
always, it is the callerâ€™s responsibility to deliver these calls so
the dancers understand what is desired.

Timing numbers in the Thar Family do not count turning the Thar.

## Allemande Thar

"Allemande Thar" is a formation. It also appears on
the Basic list of calls, not as a call by itself, but rather as a
collection of commands that result in a Thar. The commands function as
suffixes, making a Left Arm Turn end in a Thar. Descriptive words are
often part of these commands.

### Starting formation

Blended from a Left Arm Turn

### Command examples

#### Walk Around The Corner; Turn Partner Left And Make An Allemande Thar
#### Walk Around Your Corner; Turn Partner Left For An Allemande Thar, Men In The Middle Of A Backup Star
#### Walk Around The Corner; Turn Partner Left A Full Turn, Girls In The Middle Of An Allemande Thar
#### Do Paso, Turn Partner Left, Corner Right, Partner Left, Boys Swing In To A Thar
#### Boys Make A Right Hand Star, Turn It Once Around, Find Your Corner, Turn Corner Left To An Allemande Thar Star With The Girls In The Center
#### Right And Left Grand, But On Your Fourth Hand Make An Allemande Thar, Men Back In

### Dance action

Dancers continue to Left Arm Turn 1/2. The centers form a right-hand
star and back up. Outside dancers hold the left forearm of a center
dancer and walk forward.

### Ending formation

Thar in motion

### Timing

2 (for the Left Arm Turn 1/2)

### Styling

The dancers in the center, backing up, will form a Pack-saddle Star. These center dancers must remember to allow those on the outside, who travel farther, to set the pace.

Women, if on the outside, may use skirt work.

### Comments

Callers often specify who ends in the center. This is
particularly helpful in non-standard applications.

In most cases, dancers Left Arm Turn 1/2. That is, if the
dancers take forearm holds when shoulder-to-shoulder, the dancer who
begins on the outside will end in the center. Callers may specify a
different amount of turning. For example: Circle Left, Turn Your
Corner Left All The Way Around To An Allemande Thar, Men In The
Center.

Allemande Thar is part of circle choreography. It is improper
from Left Hand Waves to call Turn Partner Left to An Allemande Thar.

"Allemande Left to an Allemande Thar" has a specific meaning
described below. It does not mean to Left Arm Turn with corner
and continue to a Thar. For that action "Allemande Left, Hang On To
Corner, Women Wheel In To An Allemande Thar" could be used.

### Comments

To avoid dancer confusion with Allemande Thar, the
caller must always include some instructions about "going forward".
Simply calling "Allemande Left To An Allemande Thar" is improper.
Furthermore, although going forward two is most common, it must be
specified.

The caller can direct the dancers to Go Forward any number of
hands. Each hand is a Pull By, except the last hand, which is
normally the start of an Arm Turn into a Thar or Wrong Way Thar.

## Wrong Way Thar

"Wrong Way Thar" is a formation. It also appears on the Mainstream
list of calls, not as a call by itself, but rather as a collection of
commands that result in a Wrong Way Thar. The commands function as
suffixes, making a Right Arm Turn end in a Wrong Way Thar. Descriptive
words are often part of these commands.

### Starting formation

Blended from a Right Arm Turn

### Command examples

#### Allemande Left; Turn Partner Right, Girls Swing In Make A Wrong Way Thar
#### Allemande Left; Turn Partner Right A Full Turn, Boys Swing In Make A Wrong Way Thar
#### Turn Partner Left; Turn Corner Right To A Wrong Way Thar (men will be in the middle)
#### Do Paso; (at the end of the Do Paso) Go To The Corner Turn Her By The Right, Make A Wrong Way Thar
#### Allemande Left In The Alamo Style; Swing Thru; Turn By The Right 3/4 To A Wrong Way Thar

Arm Turn 1/2. The centers form a left-hand star and back up. Outside
