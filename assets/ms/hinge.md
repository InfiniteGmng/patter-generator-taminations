# Single Hinge / Couples Hinge

Hinge is a half Trade of adjacent dancers.
Below are the two Mainstream versions of Hinge.

## Single Hinge

### Starting formation

Mini-Wave only

### Command Examples

#### Single Hinge
#### Hinge
#### Couples Circulate; Centers Hinge
#### Heads Pass The Ocean; Extend; Split Circulate; Girls Cast Off 3/4; Boys Hinge

### Dance Action

1/2 Trade

### Ending Formation

Mini-Wave

### Timing

2

### Styling

Dancers maintain their handhold

### Comments

"Hinge 1/4" is improper, because Hinge is not used with fractions, as opposed to Touch 1/4.

Partner Hinge (starting formation: Couple only)
was removed from the Mainstream program in 1988.
The command "Hinge" can be used for either Single Hinge or Partner Hinge,
but the latter is improper at Mainstream.

## Couples Hinge

One-Faced Line and Two-Faced Line only

### Command Example

#### Couples Hinge

### Dance Action

1/2 Couples Trade

### Ending Formation

Two-Faced Line

### Styling

Each couple maintains their handholds

### Comments

From a Grand One-Faced Line, Couples Hinge ends in Right-Hand Two-Faced Lines
(i.e., lined up with each other and not offset).
