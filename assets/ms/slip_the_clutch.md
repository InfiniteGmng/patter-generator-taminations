### Dance action

Any backward motion is stopped as outside dancers release
armholds with the adjacent centers. All dancers move forward around
the center of the set to the next dancer.

On the command to Skip (or Pass) one or more dancers, everyone
walks forward within their circle, passing the indicated number of
dancers.

### Ending formation

Thar, Wrong Way Thar

### Timing

2

### Styling

Despite the change of moving direction, center dancers can make
the switch flowing and comfortable if the armhold is released
effortlessly and that same hand is held ready for the next call. The
handhold after a Slip The Clutch depends on the next call.

Center dancers generally maintain their star.

### Comment

The [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) does not apply to this call.
