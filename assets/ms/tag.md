# Tag the Line (In/Out/Left/Right)

### Starting formation

General Line

### Command examples

#### Tag The Line
#### Tag The Line All The Way
#### Tag The Line, Face Right
#### Tag The Line, Left
#### Tag The Line, Face In

### Dance action

Each dancer turns 90 degrees, in
place, to face the center of the line and then walks forward, passing
right shoulders with all dancers in the other half of the line, until
the last dancers in each half have passed each other. If a facing
direction is given, each dancer then turns 90 degrees, in place,
toward the specified direction.

### Ending formation

Tag The Line ends in back-to-back Tandems.

Tag The Line, Face Right (or Left) ends in a Right-Hand (or Left-Hand) Two-Faced Line.

### Timing

6

### Styling

Arms in natural dance position, hands ready to assume
appropriate position for the next call. If the centers start holding
right hands, a flowing type of movement can be achieved by taking a
slight step forward while turning toward the center of the line.

### Comments

Tag The Line is a 4-dancer call. From a General Line of 8, the
phrase “Each Side” (or “Each Four”) is helpful but not required.

After Tag The Line, the direction In (or Out) means to turn
toward (or away from) the center of the set. From General Lines, Tag
The Line, Face In (or Out) ends in Facing Lines (or Lines
Back-to-Back).

The direction given does not have to be the same for all
dancers, e.g., Tag The Line, Boys Face Left, Girls Face Right.

An extended application of Tag The Line begins from a General
Line containing six or eight dancers. The caller must explicitly
identify the line, e.g., “Line of Eight, Tag The Line”. The
application from a line of two dancers is improper at Mainstream; it
has a separate name and is in another program.
