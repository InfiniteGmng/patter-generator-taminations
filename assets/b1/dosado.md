## Dosado

### Starting formation

Facing Dancers

### Command examples

#### Dosado
#### Dosado your corner
#### Dosado your partner
#### Head Men Dosado
#### Heads Go Forward And Back; Heads Dosado
### Dance action

Walking a smooth circular path, dancers walk forward, passing right shoulders, slide
sideways to the right, walk backwards, passing left shoulders, and slide slightly to the left to return to
their starting position.

### Ending formation

Facing Dancers

### Timing

Designated dancers from a Squared Set, returning to a Squared Set: 8; otherwise 6

### Styling

Men: arms in natural dance position, right shoulders forward as right shoulders pass, left
shoulders forward as left shoulders pass. Women: both hands on skirt, moving skirt forward and back
to avoid opposite dancer, right hand forward as right shoulders pass, left hand forward as left shoulders
pass.

Some new dancers dance Dosado with their arms crossed in front of them. While this indicates that
the dancer has been exposed to square dancing in the past, it is not the recommended styling today.

### Comments
 
The command "Dosado Your Corner" is a shorthand for "Face Your Corner; Dosado". The same
for "Dosado Your Partner".

The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this call. The ending formation remains Facing Dancers.

From a Squared Set, Head Men Dosado is acceptable. They approach each other, Dosado, and return
to their original position.

A Dosado which starts by passing left shoulders is called Left Dosado.

Formerly the phrase See Saw was occasionally used to accomplish a Left Dosado. In 2003 the
Mainstream Committee voted to drop that application of See Saw and requests that callers use Left
Dosado.
