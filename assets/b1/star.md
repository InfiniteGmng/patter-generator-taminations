### Dance action

The designated dancers form a star by stepping forward if necessary and placing the
appropriate hand in the center of the formation. Forming the star may require a dancer to individually
turn in place up to 3/8 of a turn.

Dancers turn the star by walking forward in a circle around the center of the star. The distance
traveled may be specified in fractions of a star full around, or until some condition is met (e.g., Men
Center Left Hand Star, Pick Up Your Partner with an Arm Around, Star Promenade).

### Ending formation

Star plus an adjustment. Each dancer knows his position on the floor by how far the
star turned, and adjusts his facing direction as appropriate for the next call.

### Timing

1/2: 4, 3/4: 6, Full: 8

### Styling

Palm star (see “Additional Detail: Styling: Arms and hands”). Men's outside arms in natural dance
position, women's outside hands work skirt.

Some areas dance any stars containing men with a Pack-saddle Star (see “Additional Detail: Styling: Arms and
hands”).

### Comments

The stars described above are 4-dancer stars. Stars of 3 or more dancers are also proper, as
long as the caller's instructions to the dancers are understood.

Some callers use 2-dancer stars in place of Arm Turns, accomplishing the hands up styling necessary
in Ocean Waves, and having one less call to teach. While this is acceptable in a teaching situation, and
may be a logical way to understand stars (i.e., 2 or more dancers), 2-dancer stars are not commonly
encountered at dances.
