### Comments

The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this call.

At Basic and Mainstream,
Courtesy Turn is restricted to a man turning a woman.

At Basic and Mainstream, from Facing Lines
in which the centers form a Normal Couple, the caller
should not use "Right and Left Thru"
in the expectation that only the centers will do the call (because
they are the only ones who can due to the above restriction).
The proper call would be "Centers Right and Left Thru".

On the call "Right and Left Thru, Full Turn",
the Courtesy Turn will be for a full 360 degrees, and the
ending formation will be Couples Back-To-Back.
See "Additional Detail: Commands: Fractions".

On the call "Right and Left Thru and 1/4 More",
the Courtesy Turn will be for 270 degrees, and the
ending formation will be a Right-Hand Two-Faced Line.
See "Additional Detail: Commands: Fractions".
