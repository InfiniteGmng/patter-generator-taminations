# Pull By

- **Right Pull By:** From Facing Dancers, dancers take right hands as if they were going to shake hands,
exert a momentary, gentle pull to initiate forward motion, and perform a Pass Thru action. As the
dancers pass each other, the handhold is released and the dancers continue the next dance action or
adjust to end back-to-back. The handhold should be just firm enough to establish connection, allowing
either dancer to disengage at will. The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this action.
- **Left Pull By:** Same as Right Pull By but starting with left hands and passing left shoulders.
- **Pull By** (e.g., "Box The Gnat; Pull By"): From Facing Dancers only with right (or left) hands already
joined: Right (or Left) Pull By
