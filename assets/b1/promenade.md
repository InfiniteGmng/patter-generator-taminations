# Promenade Family

A promenade is a walk around the set by some or all dancers. The active dancers may go as individuals
or as couples. They may go in promenade direction (counterclockwise when viewed from above) or
wrong way promenade direction. They may travel all the way around the set or a shorter distance.
When not all dancers are active, there is a further choice of traveling around the inside or outside of
the set.

## Couples (Full, 1/2, 3/4)

### Starting formations

Promenade, Squared Set, Right and Left Grand Circle (men facing counterclockwise,
women facing clockwise)

### Command examples

#### Promenade Home
#### Heads Promenade Half (or Halfway)
#### Promenade, Keep Walking
#### Promenade, Don't stop, don't slow down
#### Sides Promenade 3/4
#### Heads Pass Thru, Promenade 3/4, while Sides Right and Left Thru
#### All Promenade to the ladies home position
### Dance action

If necessary, adjust to a Promenade formation as follows:
A couple will turn as a unit to face promenade direction (counterclockwise)

From a Right and Left Grand Circle,
women turn around in a comfortable direction while men step forward (and to the inside)
to form normal couples.

As a unit, each couple walks in a circular path around the center of the set.
If certain couples are named, they promenade around the outside of the set unless directed otherwise.

Couples walk the designated amount, if specified.
On the command "Promenade Home" the couples promenade to the man's home position.
In both these cases, each couple ends by turning as a unit to face the center of the set.
On the other hand, if directed to Keep Walking, couples do not turn in
but rather continue walking until the next command is given.

### Ending formations

Squared Set (e.g., Promenade Home), Promenade (e.g., Promenade, Keep Walking),
or couples facing in on the outside of the set (e.g., Sides Promenade 3/4; Heads Right and Left Thru).

### Timing

1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16

### Styling

When all Promenade, the inside dancer's distance from the center of the set is slightly
greater than that of a Star Promenade. If the formation becomes too spread out,
the outside dancers will have to walk too far and too fast for proper timing.

The styling for Promenade varies widely. CALLERLAB
recommends a certain styling (described below), but new dancers
should also be taught the popular styling for their club and
their region. Experienced dancers may choose among the various
alternatives based on club and regional standards, the previous
call, the caller's timing, and their partners’ preferences. For
simplicity, the following descriptions are given assuming a
normal couple. There are several alternative handhold positions
used while promenading. While CALLERLAB recommends the Skater's
position (described below), new dancers should be taught the
handhold position in popular use in their region and at their
club.

Dancers’ left hands are joined in front, with the woman’s left hand, palm down,
resting on the man’s left hand, palm up. Some common alternatives for placement of the right hands are:

*Skater's position (CALLERLAB recommended):* Right hands
are similarly joined with the man’s right forearm over the
woman’s left forearm. Some dancers move their hands in time to
the music.

*Skirt Skater's position:* The man’s right arm is behind
the woman’s back, right hands joined at the right side of the
woman’s waist. In a variation, the man’s right hand is placed in
the middle of her lower back while the woman’s right hand holds
and works her skirt. (See "Skirt Work" in "Part 4: Additional
Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues".)



*Varsouvienne position:*The woman's right arm is bent, and
her hand is palm up near her shoulder while the man's right arm
is behind her, his right hand palm down in her right palm.


In addition to the alternatives mentioned above, when designated dancers Promenade a specified distance from a Squared Set (e.g., Heads Promenade 1/2), the couple handhold is also acceptable. This is also common when couples are sashayed or same-sex.

When dancers are not directed to Keep Walking, there are several ways in which they can finish. In all cases, handholds should blend smoothly to end with a couple handhold. Sometimes they simply turn as a couple to face in. At other times they end with a twirl (see "Twirls" in "Part 4: Additional Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues"), in which case the twirl should finish as the couple arrives at their destination. There are two alternatives:
- Right hands, if joined, are dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined left hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.
- Only from the CALLERLAB-recommended position, left hands can instead be dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined right hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.



### Comments


Especially in singing calls, Promenade Home is usually more
than a quarter of the way around the set. If not, dancers are
often expected to add a full promenade. As necessary, callers
should make it clear what is desired.

On Heads Promenade 1/2, the Sides momentarily step toward the
center of the set to make room for those promenading. On Heads
Promenade 3/4 (or 1/4), the Sides step into the center and remain
there.

When couples Promenade, it is usually as normal couples.
Other applications may require workshopping.

When couples are sashayed or same-sex, Promenade Home can be
ambiguous (unless everyone is paired with their original partner),
and the caller must further specify where couples should end
(e.g., Promenade to the girl’s home).

The previous call can blend into Promenade. For example, from
Facing Lines, Reverse Flutterwheel, Promenade Home. See "Part 4:
Additional Detail: Blending one call into another".


## Single File Promenade
### Starting formations

Infacing Circle Of 8, Squared Set, Columns
### Command examples

#### Women Promenade Inside, Go Single File
#### 4 Ladies Promenade Inside; Get back home and Swing your guy
#### 4 Ladies Promenade Inside The Ring, Come Back And Give Your Man A Swing
#### All Promenade Single File; Ladies Backtrack
#### Promenade Single File; Men turn in and Star by the Right
#### Promenade; Put the Lady in the Lead, Go Single File
#### Promenade Go Single File, Ladies Lead And Strut A While
#### Circle Right; Drop hands; Single File Promenade
#### Circle Left; Drop hands; Single File Promenade
#### Circle Left; Same direction, Single File Promenade
#### Circle Left; Reverse back single file
#### Couple 1, turn your backs on your partner and Promenade around the outside of the set
#### Left Touch 1/4; Single File Promenade Home
### Dance action


Initial turn: If the dancers have a facing direction around the set (e.g., Columns, Promenade
and put the lady in front), no initial turn is necessary. If the dancers are circling they will turn to face
the circling direction. If 4 dancers are designated from a Squared Set (e.g., Ladies Single File
Promenade), they will step into the center and face promenade direction.

Actives move forward around the set (on the inside, or outside if so directed), in single file (one behind
another). The next call determines when the dancers stop and what they do next.

### Ending formation
 determined by the next call
### Timing
Four dancers promenade inside to home: 8
### Styling


In Single File Promenade man's arms are held in natural dance position; woman's hands on skirt,
working with the natural swinging motion.

When there are active dancers promenading around the outside of the set, the inactive dancers should
take a step toward the center of the set to assist the active dancers in their trip around the outside.
After all active dancers have passed by, the inactives step backward to return to place.

In some areas, while 4 active dancers promenade inside, the inactive dancers clap in time to the music.
Comment: In the past Single File Promenade has not been used with fractions. Recently some callers are
extending the fractional Promenade dance action to Single File Promenade. Dancers do not face in
after they have promenaded the requested amount.

## Wrong Way Promenade

### Starting formations

Squared Set, Right-Hand Two-Faced Lines, Right and Left Grand Circle (only with men facing wrong way promenade direction and women facing promenade direction)

### Command examples

#### Wrong Way Promenade Home
#### Wrong Way Promenade, keep walking
#### Heads Lead Right; Veer Left; Promenade Wrong Way, don't slow down; Heads Wheel Around
#### Veer Left; Couples Circulate; Promenade this way home
#### Heads Wrong Way Promenade 3/4
#### All Promenade; All Wheel Around; Wrong Way Promenade; girls Star Right, boys Backtrack
#### Allemande Left; turn partner right a full turn to a Wrong Way Thar; boys Run; Wrong Way Promenade
#### Wrong Way Grand; Wrong Way Promenade Home

### Dance action

Wrong Way Promenade is just like Promenade, except dancers go clockwise (i.e., in the opposite direction of Promenade). However, when starting from a Right And Left Grand Circle with genders as described in the starting formation above, the necessary adjustment, like for Promenade, involves the women turning around as the men step forward, but the men must step to the outside to form normal couples.

### Ending formations

Squared Set (e.g., Wrong Way Promenade Home), Wrong Way Promenade (e.g., Wrong Way Promenade, Keep Walking), or couples facing in on the outside of the set (e.g., Sides Wrong Way Promenade 3/4; Heads Square Thru 3).

### Timing
 1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16
### Styling
 Same as for Promenade.
### Comments


Wrong Way Promenade is infrequently called and is usually used from normal couples, i.e., the girls will be on the inside.

Some callers omit “Wrong Way” or say “This Way” if dancers are already moving in or facing in wrong way promenade direction.

Also see the comments for Promenade (#5a).

## Star Promenade
### Starting formation

4-dancer star in the center of the set and 4 dancers around the outside of the set
### Command examples

#### Men Center With A Left-Hand Star, Go Once Around; Pick Up Your Partner With An Arm Around; Star Promenade
#### 4 Men Make A Left-Hand Star; Pick Up Your Partner With An Arm Around; Star Promenade
#### 4 Ladies Make A Right-Hand Star; Pick Up Your Partner With An Arm Around; Star Promenade
#### Heads Make A Right-Hand Star; Pick Up Your Corner With An Arm Around; Star Promenade
#### Heads Make A Left-Hand Star; Pass Your Corner And Pick Up The Same Sex; Star Promenade
### Dance action

Directed dancers (e.g., men) form (or are already in) a star and turn it. When they encounter
the next directed dancer (e.g., partner) they become a couple, and promenade while retaining the center
star.
### Ending formation

Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade with centers forming a star; the dancers will be
closer together than usual because of the star and arm around the waist.
### Timing
 1/2: 6, 3/4: 9, Full: 12, Full plus a back out at home: 16
### Styling

The center star uses the same styling as Right- or Left-Hand Stars. Couples in the star have their
adjacent arms around each other's waists in a modified couple's hold. Any women on the outside use
their outside hand for skirt work. Any men on the outside have their outside hand on their waists or
at their sides.
### Comments


Here are some calls used while Star Promenading:

(women on the outside) Girls Backtrack
Centers Back Out With A Full Turn Around And A Little Bit More; Join 16 and Circle Left
Boys Raise Your Left Hands; Girls Duck Thru To The Partner; Right And Left Grand
Back Out At Home

Here is an example of 2-dancer stars being used with Star Promenade:
