# Promenade Family

A promenade is a walk around the set by some or all dancers. The active dancers may go as individuals
or as couples. They may go in promenade direction (counterclockwise when viewed from above) or
wrong way promenade direction. They may travel all the way around the set or a shorter distance.
When not all dancers are active, there is a further choice of traveling around the inside or outside of
the set.

## Couples (Full, 1/2, 3/4)

### Starting formations

Promenade, Squared Set, Right and Left Grand Circle (men facing counterclockwise,
women facing clockwise), Squared Set, Left-Hand Two-Faced Lines

### Command examples

#### Promenade Home
#### Heads Promenade Half (or Halfway)
#### Promenade, Keep Walking
#### Promenade, Don't stop, don't slow down
#### Sides Promenade 3/4
#### Heads Pass Thru, Promenade 3/4, while Sides Right and Left Thru
#### All Promenade to the ladies home position
### Dance action

If necessary, adjust to a Promenade formation as follows:
- A couple will turn as a unit to face promenade direction (counterclockwise)
- From a Right and Left Grand Circle,
women turn around in a comfortable direction while men step forward (and to the inside)
to form normal couples.

As a unit, each couple walks in a circular path around the center of the set.
If certain couples are named, they promenade around the outside of the set unless directed otherwise.

Couples walk the designated amount, if specified.
On the command "Promenade Home" the couples promenade to the man's home position.
In both these cases, each couple ends by turning as a unit to face the center of the set.
On the other hand, if directed to Keep Walking, couples do not turn in
but rather continue walking until the next command is given.

### Ending formations

Squared Set (for example, Promenade Home), Promenade (for example, Promenade, Keep Walking),
or couples facing in on the outside of the set (for example, Sides Promenade 3/4; Heads Right and Left Thru).

### Timing

1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16

### Styling

When all Promenade, the inside dancer's distance from the center of the set is slightly
greater than that of a Star Promenade. If the formation becomes too spread out,
the outside dancers will have to walk too far and too fast for proper timing.

The styling for Promenade varies widely. CALLERLAB
recommends a certain styling (described below), but new dancers
should also be taught the popular styling for their club and
their region. Experienced dancers may choose among the various
alternatives based on club and regional standards, the previous
call, the caller's timing, and their partners’ preferences. For
simplicity, the following descriptions are given assuming a
normal couple. There are several alternative handhold positions
used while promenading. While CALLERLAB recommends the Skater's
position (described below), new dancers should be taught the
handhold position in popular use in their region and at their
club.

Dancers’ left hands are joined in front, with the woman’s left hand, palm down,
resting on the man’s left hand, palm up. Some common alternatives for placement of the right hands are:

- Skater's position (CALLERLAB recommended): Right hands
are similarly joined with the man’s right forearm over the
woman’s left forearm. Some dancers move their hands in time to
the music.

- Skirt Skater's position: The man’s right arm is behind
the woman’s back, right hands joined at the right side of the
woman’s waist. In a variation, the man’s right hand is placed in
the middle of her lower back while the woman’s right hand holds
and works her skirt. (See "Skirt Work" in "Part 4: Additional
Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues".)

- Varsouvienne position: The woman's right arm is bent, and
her hand is palm up near her shoulder while the man's right arm
is behind her, his right hand palm down in her right palm.

In addition to the alternatives mentioned above, when designated dancers Promenade a specified distance from a Squared Set (for example, Heads Promenade 1/2), the couple handhold is also acceptable. This is also common when couples are sashayed or same-sex.

When dancers are not directed to Keep Walking, there are several ways in which they can finish. In all cases, handholds should blend smoothly to end with a couple handhold. Sometimes they simply turn as a couple to face in. At other times they end with a twirl (see "Twirls" in "Part 4: Additional Detail: Styling: Other styling terms and issues"), in which case the twirl should finish as the couple arrives at their destination. There are two alternatives:
- Right hands, if joined, are dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined left hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.
- Only from the CALLERLAB-recommended position, left hands can instead be dropped. Then the man leads the twirl by raising their joined right hands, gently guiding the woman through a clockwise twirl underneath.

### Comments

Especially in singing calls, Promenade Home is usually more
than a quarter of the way around the set. If not, dancers are
often expected to add a full promenade. As necessary, callers
should make it clear what is desired.

On Heads Promenade 1/2, the Sides momentarily step toward the
center of the set to make room for those promenading. On Heads
Promenade 3/4 (or 1/4), the Sides step into the center and remain
there.

When couples Promenade, it is usually as normal couples.
Other applications may require workshopping.

When couples are sashayed or same-sex, Promenade Home can be
ambiguous (unless everyone is paired with their original partner),
and the caller must further specify where couples should end
(for example, Promenade to the girl’s home).

The previous call can blend into Promenade. For example, from
Facing Lines, Reverse Flutterwheel, Promenade Home. See "Part 4:
Additional Detail: Blending one call into another".


## Single File Promenade

### Starting formations

Infacing Circle Of 8, Squared Set, Columns

### Command examples

#### Four Girls Promenade inside the ring; come back and give your guy a Swing
#### Men Promenade inside, go single file
#### All Promenade Single File; girls Backtrack
#### Couples Promenade; put the lady in the lead, go single file
#### Circle Right; drop hands; Single File Promenade
#### Couple 1, turn your back on your partner and Promenade this way around the outside of the set
#### Promenade Single File; men turn in and Star by the Right
#### Left Touch 1/4; Single File Promenade Home (from Facing Lines)
#### Circle Left; drop hands, go single file (that is, Wrong Way Single File Promenade)

### Dance action

When some dancers are designated from a Squared Set (for example, Ladies Single File Promenade), they
will initially step forward into the center.

Designated dancers turn, if necessary, to face promenade direction and move forward around the center of the
set, in single file (one behind another). The next call determines when the dancers stop and what they do next.

### Ending formation

Single File Promenade (possibly with fewer than eight dancers), Squared Set (for example, Single File
Promenade Home)
 
### Timing

Four dancers promenade inside to home: 8

### Styling

In Single File Promenade man's arms are held in natural dance position; woman's hands on skirt,
working with the natural swinging motion.

When there are active dancers promenading around the outside of the set, the inactive dancers should
take a step toward the center of the set to assist the active dancers in their trip around the outside.
After all active dancers have passed by, the inactives step backward to return to place.

### Comments

If dancers facing out are designated to Single File Promenade (for example, Heads Pass Thru, Promenade
Single File), they step forward and promenade outside.

Dancers moving individually and in the opposite direction from Promenade is called Wrong Way Single File
Promenade (for example, Walk Around Your Corner; See Saw; four boys Wrong Way Single File Promenade inside).

Some callers use fractions with Single File Promenade (for example Heads Single File Promenade 1/2). The dancers
will stay in this single file formation until the next command is given.

## Wrong Way Promenade

### Starting formations

Squared Set, Right-Hand Two-Faced Lines, Right and Left Grand Circle (only with men facing wrong way promenade direction and women facing promenade direction)

### Command examples

#### Wrong Way Promenade Home
#### Wrong Way Promenade, keep walking
#### Heads Lead Right; Veer Left; Promenade Wrong Way, don't slow down; Heads Wheel Around
#### Veer Left; Couples Circulate; Promenade this way home
#### Heads Wrong Way Promenade 3/4
#### All Promenade; All Wheel Around; Wrong Way Promenade; girls Star Right, boys Backtrack
#### Allemande Left; turn partner right a full turn to a Wrong Way Thar; boys Run; Wrong Way Promenade
#### Wrong Way Grand; Wrong Way Promenade Home

### Dance action

Wrong Way Promenade is just like Promenade, except dancers go clockwise (that is, in the opposite direction of Promenade). However, when starting from a Right And Left Grand Circle with genders as described in the starting formation above, the necessary adjustment, like for Promenade, involves the women turning around as the men step forward, but the men must step to the outside to form normal couples.

### Ending formations

Squared Set (for example, Wrong Way Promenade Home), Wrong Way Promenade (for example, Wrong Way Promenade, Keep Walking), or couples facing in on the outside of the set (for example, Sides Wrong Way Promenade 3/4; Heads Square Thru 3).

### Timing

1/4: 4, 1/2: 8, 3/4: 12, Full: 16

### Styling

Same as for Promenade.

### Comments

Wrong Way Promenade is infrequently called and is usually used from normal couples, that is, the girls will be on the inside.

Some callers omit “Wrong Way” or say “This Way” if dancers are already moving in or facing in wrong way promenade direction.

Also see the comments for Promenade Couples (Full, 1/2, 3/4)

## Star Promenade

### Starting formation

4-dancer star in the center of the set and 4 dancers around the outside of the set

### Command examples

#### Men make a Left-Hand Star, go once around; pick up your partner with an arm around, Star Promenade; back out at home
#### Four Ladies make a Right-Hand Star; pick up your partner, Star Promenade; Boys Backtrack
#### Heads make a Right-Hand Star; pick up your corner with an arm around, Star Promenade; Centers back out with a full turn around and a little bit more; join 16 and Circle Left


### Dance action

Directed dancers (for example, men) form (or are already in) a star and turn it. When they encounter
the next directed dancer (for example, partner) they become a couple, and promenade while retaining the center
star.

### Ending formation

Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade with centers forming a star; the dancers will be
closer together than usual because of the star and arm around the waist.

### Timing

1/2: 6, 3/4: 9, Full: 12, Full plus a back out at home: 16

### Styling

The center star uses the same styling as Right- or Left-Hand Stars. Couples in the star have their
adjacent arms around each other's waists in a modified couple's hold. Any women on the outside use
their outside hand for skirt work. Any men on the outside have their outside hand on their waists or
at their sides.

### Comment

Star Promenade is occasionally used with a 2-dancer star. For example, Head Men make a Left-Hand
Star; pick up your partner with an arm around and Star Promenade; she picks up her corner with an arm
around and keep on moving; now he picks up his partner; all Bend The Big Line
