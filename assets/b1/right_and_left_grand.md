## Right and Left Grand

### Starting formations

Right and Left Grand Circle, Eight Chain Thru, Trade By plus the ends Face In

Any of the above in which some or all dancers have stepped to a mini-wave, or any formation in which
dancers may conveniently turn up to 90 degrees so the men face promenade direction, women face
wrong way promenade direction, and the formation is now one of the above.

### Command examples

#### Right and Left Grand
#### Grand Right and Left

### Dance action

If necessary, men turn up to 90 degrees to face promenade direction and women turn up to
90 degrees to face reverse promenade direction. Dancers blend into a circular formation as they Right
Pull By, Left Pull By, Right Pull By, Left Pull By.

### Ending formation

Right and Left Grand Circle

### Timing

10

### Styling

Hands are involved with alternating pull-by movements, no twirls. Arms should be held in
natural dance position and the handhold position should be released as dancers pass each other. Men
particularly should stand tall and resist the temptation to lean over and stretch out their hand to the
next person. Just a comfortable extension of the arm and hand is all that is necessary.

## Weave the Ring

### Starting formation

Right and Left Grand Circle

### Command example

#### Weave The Ring

### Dance action

Dancers do a no-hands Right and Left Grand.

### Ending formation

Right and Left Grand Circle

### Timing

### Styling

Women work their skirt with both hands as they move around the square. Men hold hands in
natural dance position. Dancers lead with their right shoulder as they pass the dancer on the right,
then with the left shoulder as they pass the dancer on the left. Brief eye contact should be made as they
meet each dancer. Attention should be paid to keeping the circle a reasonable size (i.e., not too large).

### Comments

Some groups have flourishes which extend the timing to 16 beats requiring a phrased delivery.

Weave The Ring is best danced to a well timed delivery, often preceded by an Allemande Left. Surprise
or variety in starting formations is not recommended. While the Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call,
its application is also not recommended.
