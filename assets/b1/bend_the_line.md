# Bend the Line

## Case 1: One-Faced Line, Two-Faced Line (4 dancers)

### Starting formations

One-Faced Line, Two-Faced Line

### Command examples

#### Bend The Line
#### Each Side, Bend The Line (from a Tidal Line or Tidal Two-Faced Line)

### Dance action

Each half of the line, working as a unit,
turns 90 degrees to face the center of the formation.

### Ending formation

 Facing Couples

### Timing

4

### Styling

As ends move forward, the centers back up, equally. Use a couple handhold. In the event a new
line is formed, immediately join hands in the new line.

### Comments

From a Tidal formation it is helpful, but not necessary, to say "Each Side".

A couple on the outside of the set (e.g., after a Couples Circulate 1 1/2) can be asked to Bend The Line.
In this case, they assume the other half of their line is towards the center of the set and, working as a
unit, turn 90 degrees to face the center of the set.

## Case 2: Tidal Line (8 dancers)

### Starting formation

Tidal Line

### Command examples

#### Line of 8, Bend The Line
#### Bend The Big Line
#### Work 4 By 4 and Bend The Line

### Dance action

Same as above.

### Ending formation
 
Facing Lines

### Timing

6

### Styling

Retain handholds in each half of the line. As the very ends move forward, the very centers back
up, equally. Adjust to Facing Lines at the end.

### Comments

From a line of 6, the call "Lines of 6, Bend The Line"
is also acceptable.

Attempts to get dancers to bend lines of 2 dancers
(e.g., Bend The Little Bitty Line) are considered very
unusual and should not be used.
