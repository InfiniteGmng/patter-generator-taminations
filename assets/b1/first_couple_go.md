### Dance action

Dancers, with each couple working as a unit, walk forward in an arc in the indicated
direction. The center couple walks forward before taking the second direction given.

If the couples are asked to go in opposite directions
(for example, First Couple Go Left, Next Couple Go Right),
they should move in a tight circle in their specified direction
for half a circle. At this point they will be
facing another couple and the ending formation will be Facing Lines.
The other couple in their line will
be the couple that started facing the same way immediately ahead of or behind them.

If both couples are asked to go in the same direction
(for example, First Couple Go Left, Next Couple Go Left)
the ending formation is a Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade, and the next call is usually
Promenade.

### Ending formations

Facing Lines, Promenade

### Timing

6

### Styling

Use couple handholds. Dancers in each couple who are making the tighter turn serve as the pivot
point and should exert slight pressure to assist as in any wheel around movement.
If the next call is
Promenade, adjust to a promenade handhold.

### Comment

The following sequence is occasionally used (women must be centers): Tag The Line (or Double
Pass Thru); Lady Go Left, Gent Go Right, Allemande Left. The "Go"
gets the dancers turning in the
specified direction, and the immediate Allemande Left successfully completes the sequence. These
definitions are not going to further define "Go"
and recommend that callers should not expand on this usage.
