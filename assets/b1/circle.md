# Circle Left / Circle Right

## Case 1: 8 dancers

### Starting formations

Squared Set,Infacing Circle Of 8

### Command examples

#### Circle Left
#### Circle to the Left
#### Join Hands, Circle Left
#### Circle Right, The Other Way Back
#### (while circling left) Reverse, and Circle Right the other way back
#### Circle

### Dance action

Dancers join hands with adjacent
dancers to form a circle and move the circle in the
indicated direction, or to the left if no direction was given.
The amount to circle may be a specified
distance (e.g., Circle Left ½ Way) or until the next command is given
(e.g., Circle Left &#8230; Circle Right).

### Ending formation

Infacing Circle Of 8.
On the command "Stop At Home", the ending formation is a
Squared Set.

### Timing

¼: 4, ½: 8, ¾: 12, Full: 16

### Styling
 
As dancers join hands (couple handhold)
to form a circle, they face slightly left or right as directed.
All dancers walk forward with joined hands, elbows bent comfortably so
that hands are above the elbow.

Couple handhold in circles: In circles with alternating men and women,
men's palms are up and
women's palms are down. In other circles (e.g., BBGG), everyone has the
right-hand palm up and the
left-hand palm down.

Some regions dance 8-dancer circles with a walking step with
no turning motion of the body. Other
regions dance 8-dancer circles with a grapevine step,
with the body and arms turning left and right, in
synchrony with this step, allowing the dancers to make eye contact
with their Corners and Partners
successively.

### Comments


The command "Circle",
without a direction, is a shorthand for Circle Left. It is mainly used
in Singing Calls when required by the timing of the lyrics.

When circling, "Reverse" or "Go The Other Way"
can be used to tell the dancers to stop and circle in the
other direction. It is usually followed with a
"Circle Right (or Left)".

When dancing in a circle of 4, the dancers end as the same facing couples
rotated by the appropriate amount.

### Styling

In a mixed sex circle,
the men dance palms up and the women dance palms down. In a Same Sex
circle, dancers use right hand palm up, left hand palm down.
Some regions always use the latter
styling.

### Comments
 
While the concept of circling with 2
or more dancers is part of the Mainstream program, there
is no well established terminology. Callers wanting circles of 2 dancers
must use terminology familiar to their dancers.

Some callers use the phrase "Single Circle" for circles of 2 dancers
(e.g., Single Circle 3/4 to A Star Thru). The phrase "Single Circle" is
not explicitly listed and taught at Mainstream so this usage may
cause communication problems. In addition, the phrase
"Single Circle" is very similar to the call
"[Single Circle To A Wave](../plus/single_circle_to_a_wave.md)"
which is part of another dance program.
Some callers feel that the use of the term
"Single Circle" at Mainstream is improper.
