### Comments

See Saw is almost always preceded by Walk Around the Corner. 
Other applications may require workshopping. 
From a Circle or Squared Set, dancers begin by facing the designated dancer.

Formerly See Saw, when not used after All Around the Corner, 
had the dance action of a Left Dosado. Today callers should say Left Dosado.

"Taw" is an old term for a manâ€™s partner. Its use with See Saw dates back to a time 
when certain calls were directed primarily toward the men. 
See the comment for Walk Around The Corner.
