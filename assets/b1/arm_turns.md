### Dance action

Dancers join indicated forearms and walk forward around each other. The amount of turn
can be specified as a fraction (e.g., Half (180 degrees), 3/4 (270 degrees),
Full (360 degrees) or implicitly
by the next call (e.g., Turn Partner By the Left; 4 Ladies Chain).

### Ending formation

Usually a Mini-wave, or no formation as the dancers prepare to let go of the arm turn
and step forward to do the next call.

### Timing

1/2: 4, 3/4: 4 to 6, Full: 6 to 8

### Styling

Forearm hold

### Comments

From a Mini-Wave the distance to turn may be specified by a fraction (e.g., Arm Turn 1/2).

From Facing Dancers the distance to turn must be specified by a relative position (e.g., To A Thar, or
To Your Corner) or the next call (e.g., Turn Corner By The Right; Do Paso). It is improper to specify
a fraction.

The Mini-Wave formation does not imply a specific handhold. The styling for Arm Turns and calls
defined with Arm Turns is a Forearm hold. See the section
"Dance Action: Defining Calls with Arm Turns".
