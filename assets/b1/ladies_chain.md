# Ladies Chain Family

The general action of Ladies Chain has two or more women each
leave their current man, star (or right pull by) with each other, and
be courtesy turned by a man. The caller indicates which women are
involved and how far they star.

## Two Ladies Chain (Regular & 3/4)

This definition covers the regular Two Ladies Chain. Two Ladies
Chain 3/4 is described in the comments section.

### Starting formation

Normal Facing Couples

### Command examples

#### Head Ladies Chain
#### Right and Left Thru; Two Ladies Chain
#### Right and Left Thru; Ladies Chain
#### Side Ladies Chain Over; Side Ladies Chain Back

### Dance action

Women step toward each other and Right-Hand Star
1/2 (or Right Pull By). Each man Courtesy Turns the woman coming
toward him to end in Facing Couples.

### Ending formation

Facing Couples

### Timing

Facing Couples: 6; Squared Set: 8


### Styling

Each man releases his partner and sidesteps to the
right while turning his right shoulder slightly toward the center of
the formation blending into the Courtesy Turn. Women use skirtwork for
the Courtesy Turn (and in the star, if used).

### Comments

Two Ladies Chain is improper if either couple is sashayed or
same-sex.

From a squared set with the men at home, Head Ladies Chain is
danced by those currently at the Heads position, even if this
involves the original Side women (e.g., after Four Ladies Chain 3/4).

The next four comments refer to uncommon or regional
applications of Ladies Chain and may require workshopping.

- From a Squared Set, on the call Head Ladies Chain 3/4, often
called as “Head Ladies Chain 3/4, Side Men Turn Them”, the head
women will do their part of a Four Ladies Chain 3/4 (see below)
using a 2-dancer star. The Courtesy Turn will be with the side men,
and the ending position will be lines of 3 (boy, girl, girl) at the
sides of the set with lonesome head men at the heads of the set. The
timing of this application is 10.
- From a Squared Set, "Head Ladies Chain Right" or "Head
Ladies to the Right, Chain" has each Head couple work with the Side
couple on their right. These couples momentarily face, do the call,
and then adjust back to a Squared Set. Head Ladies Chain Right is
the same as Side Ladies Chain Left.
- From Facing Lines, “End Ladies Chain on a Diagonal” has the
right-end women chain with each other, to be Courtesy Turned by the
adjacent men, ending in Facing Lines.
- From Facing Tandems with women in front, the variation "On A
Double Track, Ladies Chain" can be used: the women Right Pull By and
Courtesy Turn with the far man. For example, Couples Circulate, Tag
the Line, Cloverleaf, On a Double Track, Ladies Chain. This may also
be called as "Single File, Ladies Chain".

## Four Ladies Chain (Regular & 3/4)

### Starting formation

Squared Set, Infacing Circle of 8, or a
"turning your partner left" formation (the dynamic formation
obtained from a square plus all arm turn your partner by the left an
indefinite amount)

### Command examples

#### Four Ladies Chain
#### Four Ladies Chain 3/4
#### All Four Ladies Chain Across
#### Chain Those Ladies Over and Back (i.e., twice)
#### Four Ladies Chain; Chain Them Home (i.e., twice)
#### Do Paso, partner left, corner right, partner left; Four Ladies Chain
#### Shoot the Star; Four Ladies Chain

### Dance action

All four women Right-Hand Star 1/2 (or 3/4, if
designated). All Courtesy Turn to face the center of the set.


### Ending formation

Squared Set

### Timing

Regular: 8, 3/4: 10

### Styling

Men use the Two Ladies Chain styling. Women use a palm
or finger tip star. If at least two women are wearing full skirts, an
elegant variation is for each lady to pick up and hold a bit of the
right edge of her skirt, or an arm's length of a long skirt, as she
reaches into the star. This arm's-length hold can be continued through
the Courtesy Turn at a comfortable height and longer if the next call
is Chain Them Back.

### Comments

Four Ladies Chain is improper if any couple is
sashayed or same-sex.

Some callers use Four Ladies Chain from normal
facing lines. This is danced as if all couples were directly facing
the center of the set except that it ends in the same facing lines. In
some areas this is an extended application, and in other areas it is
considered a gimmick. (See "Additional Detail: Commands:
Gimmicks".)


## Chain Down the Line

### Starting formation

General Line with the centers holding right hands

### Command example

Chain Down the Line

### Dance action

Centers Turn 1/2 By The Right while ends adjust as necessary.
Then the ends Courtesy Turn the centers to finish in Facing Couples.

### Ending formation

Facing Couples

### Timing

8

### Comment

At Mainstream, Chain Down the Line starts only with women as
centers and men as ends because Courtesy Turn is restricted to men
turning women.
