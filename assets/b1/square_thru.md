# Square Thru (1,2,3,4) / Left Square Thru (1,2,3,4)

### Starting formation

Facing Couples

### Command examples

#### Square Thru 4
#### Square Thru 2
#### Left Square Thru 3

### Dance action

Square Thru (1,2,3,4) is defined here; for Left Square Thru (1,2,3,4) see the comments below.

In what follows, "Face partner" means to make a 90-degree turn in place
to face oneâ€™s current partner.
Complete as many of these actions as appropriate:

- Right Pull By (Square Thru 1 has been completed)
- Face partner and Left Pull By (Square Thru 2 has been completed)
- Face partner and Right Pull By (Square Thru 3 has been completed)
- Face partner and Left Pull By (Square Thru 4 has been completed)

### Ending formation

Back-to-Back Couples

### Timing

Square Thru 1: 2  
Square Thru 2: 5  
Square Thru 3: 7 or 8  
Square Thru 4: 10

### Styling


With the Pull By the hands are released as each dancer passes each other
so as to avoid guiding one another to turn the wrong way.

As in Right and Left Grand, dancers should make their opposite hand
available for their next Pull By (or the next call). On each Pull By,
as dancers pass they should be facing Head or Side walls
(unlike Right And Left Grand, which blends into a circle).

### Comments

Left Square Thru (1,2,3,4) is similar to Square Thru (1,2,3,4) except
that it is started with the left hand and hands are alternating thereafter;
the word "Left" is required.
E.g., Heads Lead Right, Circle To A Line, Left Square Thru 4, Left Allemande.

The [Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) applies to this call.

The movement can be continued beyond 4 hands (e.g., Square Thru 5).

There are some alternative ways in which Square Thru can be called:

- "Half Square Thru" can be used for Square Thru 2
- "Square Thru 3/4" can be used for Square Thru 3
- "Square Thru" can be used for Square Thru 4


An extended application of Square Thru is
"Square Thru, on the Third (or other) Hand..."
where the Pull By action on the specified hand
blends into the following call. For example:

- Square Thru, on the Third Hand Spin the Top
- Square Thru, on the Third Hand Eight Chain 5
- Square Thru, on the Third Hand Box The Gnat and Right and Left Grand
- Square Thru, on the Fourth Hand Left Swing Thru
- Square Thru, on the Fourth Hand Left Allemande


Unless the caller specifies, the call
"Square Thru, on the Third (or other) Hand"
does not have a clear ending formation.
Some believe it ends in facing couples, others in a wave.
For this reason, the call that follows must be proper and have the same
effect from both these formations; that is, the [Facing Couples Rule](../b2/facing_couples_rule.md) or
[Ocean Wave Rule](../b2/ocean_wave_rule.md) must apply. Historically Touch 1/4 and Left Touch 1/4 are
exceptions that are considered proper, with the Pull By blending into the Touch:

- Square Thru, on the Third Hand Touch 1/4
- Square Thru, on the Fourth Hand Left Touch 1/4


The extended application Square Thru 1 1/2 (or 2 1/2, etc.)
includes half of the next Pull By and ends in an Ocean Wave.
Dancers are not expected to know this variation, so it should only
be used following an appropriate workshop.
