# Turn Back Family

Both members of this family have the dancer turn around to end facing the opposite direction.

## U-Turn Back

### Starting formation

Individual dancer

### Command examples

#### U-Turn Back
#### Men U-Turn Back
#### Centers U-Turn Back
#### Promenade, Keep Walking; Everybody U-Turn Back; Promenade this way around
#### Wheel And Deal; Centers U-Turn Back; Double Pass Thru

### Dance action

The dancer does an individual about-face turn (180 degrees) in place, turning toward partner
unless the body flow dictates otherwise. If alone (that is, no partner), the dancer turns toward the center
of the set. If the solo dancer is facing directly toward or away from the center of the set, the turn may
be in either direction.

### Ending formation

Individual dancer

### Timing

2

### Styling

Isolated dancer: Arms in natural dance position. Adjacent dancers connected with a handhold:
Release the handhold, perform the dance action, and reconnect with the appropriate handhold (couple
or mini-wave). Couples promenading in Skater's position can U-Turn Back without releasing
handholds by turning towards each other.

## Backtrack

#### Gents Step Out And Take A Backtrack

#### Star Promenade; Ladies Backtrack, Left Allemande
#### Promenade Wrong Way; Boys step out to the left and Backtrack twice around

### Dance action

The designated dancers walk in a small 180 degree arc towards the outside of the set.

### Ending formation

Various, depending on starting formation and who was designated.

Four dancers designated: Four dancers that did not do the backtrack continue starring or promenading
single file in the center of the set and four dancers that did the backtrack will promenade single file in
the opposite direction around the outside of the set.

Everyone designated: Single File Promenade

### Timing

2

### Styling

If necessary, release the handhold. Continue with arms in natural dance position.

### Comments

Backtrack requires a forward motion before the Backtrack and a forward motion (in the other
direction) after the Backtrack.

The couples version of Backtrack (for example, Promenade, Head Couples Backtrack) is no longer in use.
