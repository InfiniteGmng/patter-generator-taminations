### Dance action

Dancers join hands with those next to them, walk forward 3 steps, pause, walk backwards
3 steps, and pause.

### Ending formation

Same as starting formation

### Timing

Lines close together: 4; All others: 8

### Styling

Each dancer steps forward three steps and pauses while bringing the free foot forward and
touching it to the floor without transferring weight. Each dancer steps back three steps beginning with
the free foot and pauses while touching the free foot beside the weight-bearing foot.

From Facing Lines or similar situations in which eight counts are not appropriate, each dancer steps
forward and pauses while bringing the other foot forward and touching it to the floor without
transferring weight. Each dancer then steps back on the free foot and pauses while touching the other
foot beside it.

As couples or lines meet in the center, the end dancers may touch or clap their outside hands palm to
palm (palms flat, fingers pointed upwards).

### Comments

The timing of a Forward And Back from Facing Lines depends on several factors. In
Traditional Squares and Contras with phrased calling, it is definitely 8 steps. In Mainstream, it can
be 8 steps if the caller assures that the lines are not too close together at the start and delivers the call
in a way that encourages the dancers to take the full 8 steps (for example, Lines Go Forward ... And You Come
Back Out).

The choreographic style and delivery of Modern Western patter calling have evolved in such a way that
Forward And Back is most often danced in 4 steps.

Some callers clue the dancers to take 4 steps with phrases like "Balance Up And Back" or "Rock
Forward And Back", and otherwise expect 8 steps. Other callers believe that the distance between the
lines determines the timing, not what the caller says. Some callers only allow 4 steps.

Forward And Back is also used as a signal from the caller to any square that has broken down that it
can get started again by making normal Facing Lines and joining the sequence in progress.
