# Separate

The most general case of Separate is described first. The two most common applications are described in
greater detail next.

### Starting formation

Couple. The couple must be active or designated.

### Command examples

#### Heads Separate and Star Thru
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate and behind the Sides Touch 1/4
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate and come back home and Swing
#### Heads Star Thru; Double Pass Thru; Heads Separate and Star Thru
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate go Around Two; Meet Your Partner and Dosado
#### Couple #1 Separate around the ring ... pass her once ... and pass her again; Allemande the corner
#### Heads Pass The Ocean and Swing Thru, Others Separate and Everybody Right and Left Thru

### Dance action

Case 1: The active or designated couple is on Squared Set spots

The dancers turn back-to-back and start walking forward in opposite directions around the outside of
the square away from each other until they meet another dancer. The call ends here unless further
instructions are given (e.g., "and come back home").

Case 2: The active or designated couple is in the center facing out of the square (e.g., after Heads Slide
Thru, Square Thru 2)

The couple steps forward and then performs the Separate action described above.

### Ending formation

Facing dancers on the outside of the set or determined by the next command

### Timing

2, or determined by the distance traveled around the outside

### Styling

Inactive dancers move into the center to get out of the way of the actives. Men's arms in natural
dance position; woman's skirt work optional.

### Comments

While Separate is usually followed with instructions for walking around some number of
inactive dancers, the active dancers can also be directed to perform some other action (e.g., Separate,
walk around the outside passing 2 dancers and Star Thru with the third).

From a squared set, calling
"Heads Square Thru 2; Heads Separate, ..." would be improper because the
heads are initially facing the sides and when they start in the center they must be facing out of the
square rather than facing other dancers.

## Around 1 or 2 to a Line

### Starting formation

after a Separate

### Command examples

#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 To A Line
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 To A Line
#### Heads Separate Around 1 To A Line
#### Heads Square Thru; Split 2, Separate Around 1 To A Line
#### Heads Square Thru; Split 2, Around 1 To A Line
#### Heads Right And Left Thru; Veer Left; Tag The Line; Split The Sides, First Left, Next Right Around 1 to a Line

### Dance action

After a Separate, the active dancers walk around the outside of the set passing the
designated number of inactive dancers. The inactives act as stationary objects (referred to as
goal-posts) and do not change their facing direction. However, they should counterdance as necessary
by stepping forward to allow the actives to walk comfortably around the outside, and then step slightly
backward as the actives pass.

The active dancers pass each other as necessary, using right shoulders (as in Pass Thru). The actives
only count inactive dancers in determining how far to go.

When the active dancers walk around their last inactive dancer, they either squeeze in between the
inactive dancers (who move apart to make room) to become the centers of a general line, or stand
outside the inactive dancers to become the ends of a general line. Which action will happen depends
on where the count ends the active dancers with respect to the location of the inactive dancers.

These actions are sometimes also called
"Squeeze In -- Make Lines" or "Hook On To The End -- Make Lines",
respectively.

### Ending formation

Usually Facing Lines. Occasionally Inverted Lines or 3&1 Lines.

### Timing

Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 To A Line: 8 Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 To A
Line: 10

### Styling

Those not active move into the center to get out of the way of the actives. Men's arms in natural
dance position; ladies' skirt work optional.

### Comments

While "Around 1" and "Around 2" are the most common,
higher numbers are acceptable. In
all cases, the count is of inactive dancers passed by the active dancers.

Some callers feel that the word "Separate" is required
and the proper call is "Split 2, Separate Around 1 To A Line".

The sequence "Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 And Stand Behind The Sides"
is not proper
because each active dancer didn't go around the second inactive dancer at all.

Around 1 or 2 To A Line is not always preceded by Separate. For example, Heads Pass Thru, Both
Turn Right, Girl Around 1, Boy Around 2, To A Line.

## Around 1 or 2 and come into the middle

### Starting formation

after a Separate

### Command examples

#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 and come into the middle with a Right and Left Thru
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 and come into the middle with a Right and Left Thru
#### Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 and come down the middle with a Right and Left Thru

### Dance action

Initially the same as [Around 1 or 2 to a Line](#toaline), above.

When the active dancers pass their last inactive dancers, they will either squeeze in between and
through the inactive dancers (who move apart and back together to make room, as in the call Split 2)
to come into the center of the set and take the next call, or will continue forward in a semi-circle around
their last inactive dancers to end in the center of the set, ready to take the next call.

Once the actives enter the center of the set, they are ready to take the next call. The inactive dancers
finish on the outside of the set where they started and do not participate in the next call.

### Ending formation

- Separate Around 1 and Come Into The Middle: Double Pass Thru, Trade By, others possible
- Separate Around 2 and Come Down The Middle: Squared Set with one pair of couples active, others
possible

### Timing

Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 1 and come into the middle with a: 8  
Heads Pass Thru; Separate Around 2 and come down the middle with a: 12

### Styling

Those not active must counter dance. For example, moving forward to provide room when the
actives are on the outside, sliding apart and together when being split, and moving back to place so as
to finish on the outside. Men's arms in natural dance position; woman's skirt work optional.

### Comment

While "Around 1" and "Around 2" are the most common numbers, higher numbers are
acceptable. In all cases, the count is of inactive dancers passed by the active dancers.
