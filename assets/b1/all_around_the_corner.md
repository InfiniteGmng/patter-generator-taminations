# Walk Around the Corner

### Starting formations

Squared Set, Infacing Circle Of 8

### Command examples

#### Walk Around the Corner
#### Walk All Around Your Corner
#### 4 Ladies Chain; Circle Left; Walk Around New Corner
#### All Around the Left Hand Lady
#### Walk All Around the Left Hand Lady; See Saw the Pretty Little Taw

### Dance action

Dancers face their corners. Walking forward and
around each other while keeping right shoulders adjacent, dancers
return to their original position, with their backs toward their
corner.

### Ending formation

Right and Left Grand Circle

8

### Styling

Men hold arms in natural dance position. Women use both
hands on skirt, moving skirt forward and back to avoid opposite
dancer. Dancers should maintain eye contact over their shoulders until
their partners become visible.

### Comment

Square dancing is evolving towards a preference for
"Walk Around the Corner" instead of "All Around The
Left-Hand Lady", which requires the women to mentally translate
the command to "All Around The Right-Hand Man".
