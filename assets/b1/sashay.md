# Half Sashay Family

The calls in the Half Sashay family have the two dancers in a couple exchange places while retaining their
original facing direction.

## Half Sashay

### Starting formation

Couple

### Command examples

#### Heads Half Sashay
#### Right and Left Thru; Half Sashay
#### Sides Pass Thru, Half Sashay, and Separate Around One To A Line
#### All 4 Ladies Chain; Half Sashay; Circle Left

### Dance action

Dancers exchange places without changing facing directions. Dancer on the right side steps
to the left while the dancer on the left steps back, side steps to the right, then steps forward, ending as
a couple.

### Ending formation

Couple

### Timing

4
### Styling

Dancers use a normal couple handhold, pulling slightly toward each other as they initiate the
sashay movement. As the dancers complete the call, they catch hands to end in a couple handhold
(unless that is inconvenient for the next call).

### Comments

While the command is properly given as "Half Sashay",
it is occasionally shortened to "Sashay".
This shortened form can be confusing and should not be used.

The terms "Full Sashay" or "Sashay All The Way Around"
are not part of any dance program. This is
improper language and should not be used.

The command "Half Sashay Once and a Half"
is proper and has been seeing increased usage. It ends
in a Tandem. See the section "Part 4: Additional Detail: Fractions".

## Rollaway

### Starting formations

Couple, Infacing Circle Of 8

### Command examples

#### Rollaway
#### 4 Ladies Rollaway
#### Heads Rollaway
#### Circle Left; Rollaway; Circle Left
#### Veer Right; Ferris Wheel; Centers Rollaway
#### Roll The Girl Away
#### Boys Roll That Girl Away
#### Heads Lead Right; Veer Left; Bend The Line; Roll The Boys Away (uncommon)
#### Sides Promenade 1/2; Heads Chain Those Ladies Across, Turn That Gal; Roll Her Away

### Dance action

From a couple, the dancer on the right (or the directed dancer) "rolls" across in front of the
other dancer, turning a full 360 degrees to end on the other side, as the other dancer steps back and
then forward, adjusting sideways as necessary, to move smoothly into the vacated position. At the
completion of the call, the dancers have exchanged positions.

From an Infacing Circle Of 8 of alternating men and women, unless otherwise directed, the women roll
left across and in front of the men.

### Ending formations
 
Couple, Infacing Circle Of 8

### Timing

### Styling

For the purposes of this styling, assume a normal couple and that the woman is being rolled away.

Hands held in normal couple handhold maintaining good arm tension and connection throughout.

From a couple, the man steps back on slight right diagonal as the woman folds to face him. Continuing
the momentum they change hands. He steps forward to his right and she finishes her dance action.

When the preceding dance action is a Courtesy Turn, the hand connection is slightly different. Dancers
already have left hands joined in front. This connection is maintained throughout most of the Rollaway.
Near the end, the lady lets go with her left hand and joins her right hand with the man's left hand.

From a circle in motion, the man interrupts the circling action by stepping back and then forward,
while the woman uses the momentum of the circle to accomplish the roll-across action.

Dancers who are doing the vine step footwork while circling should perform the Rollaway as they are
starting to turn toward each other. Callers should deliver the call to accomplish this timing.

### Comments

In the past, "Rollaway" has also been called "Rollaway With A Half Sashay".
This is improper language and should not be used.

The command "Rollaway Once and a Half" is proper and sees occasional use.
It ends in Facing Dancers.
See the section "Part 4: Additional Detail: Fractions".

## Ladies In, Men Sashay

### Starting formation

Infacing Circle Of 8 of alternating men and women

### Command examples

#### Circle Left; Ladies In, Men Sashay; Circle Left
#### Circle Left; Ladies Center, Men Sashay
#### Circle Right; Ladies In, Men Sashay
#### Circle Right; Men Center, Ladies Sashay
#### Circle Left; Men Center, Ladies Sashay

### Dance action

From a Circle Left, the ladies step forward and pause while the men continue to move to the
left, behind, and past one lady. The ladies now step back and rejoin hands in a circle with the men.
From a Circle Right, the men move to the right.

### Ending formation

Infacing Circle Of 8

### Timing

4

### Styling

Men's hands in slightly up position ready to rejoin the women in the circle. Commonly women
have both hands on skirt when moving to the center and either momentarily bunch skirts or flip the
skirt front up slightly before returning to the circle.

### Comment

Used for occasional variety, any dancers can be asked to go "In"
while the others "Sashay" (for example, "Men In, Ladies Sashay")
