### Dance action

Man places his right hand against woman's left hand, palm to palm with fingers up, to make
an arch. As the dancers move forward the woman does a one quarter (90 degrees) left face turn under
the arch, while the man does a one quarter (90 degrees) turn to the right moving past the woman.

### Styling

Hands are joined in raised position at approximately eye level, palm to palm, with fingers pointed
up to form an arch. The arch will be offset to the man's right and woman's left. The man's hand should
be used to stabilize as the woman provides her own momentum. As the call is completed, the hand grip
should be readjusted to couple handhold.
