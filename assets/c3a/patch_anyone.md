Note: Determine who are the designated dancers before doing the
Hinge, not after. For example, from a Couple: Patch the Beaus is a
Partner Hinge (now both dancers are Beaus) followed by original Beau
U-Turn Back. Similarly, from Parallel Lines: Patch the Ends refers to
the original Ends, not those who become Ends after the Hinge.
