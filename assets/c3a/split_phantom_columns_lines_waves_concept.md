# Split Phantom Columns-Lines-Waves <anything>
**CONCEPT**   


From a 4x4 Matrix, visualized as 4 adjacent
Columns/Lines/Waves: Split the 4x4 Matrix into two pairs of adjacent
Columns/Lines/Waves and work in the resulting 2x4 Matrix on each
side.

Note that Split Phantom Lines only means that the dancers
should consider themselves to be in General Lines; it does not imply
any particular type of lines (e.g., two-faced, waves). Similarly,
Split Phantom Columns only means that the dancers should consider
themselves to be in General Columns.

Split Phantom Waves indicates the same groups of eight spots as
Split Phantom Lines, but with the additional implication that the
dancers in each line are facing in alternating directions. In that
case, the facing direction of every phantom can be assumed from the
facing direction of the real dancers.
