## Grand Mix

**Parts:** 2  

From a Generalized Tidal Line:
***Center pairs of dancers (3 pairs from an 8-dancer Tidal
Line, 2 pairs from a 6-dancer Tidal Line) "Grand Cross Run***"
***new Center pairs of dancers
[Trade](../b2/trade.md)***.
"Grand Cross Run"
means that the dancers in each pair do a Run into a once-removed

### Teaching Notes
From an 8-dancer line, the second part is
simply Triple Trade. Some dancers find it easier to think about the
first part as Center pairs trade (typically Triple Trade), and all
Spread. So, when getting the correct part division is not an issue,
from an eight-dancer line the call can be thought of as Triple Trade,
all Spread, and Triple Trade. Note, however, that this will not give
the correct rolling direction for the very ends.

## Grand Swing and Mix

**Parts:** 3  

From a Generalized Tidal Line: 
Swing, then do the parts of a Grand Mix. Ends in a Tidal Line.

## Grand 1/4 (or 3 /4) Mix

**Parts:** 3  

From a R-H Column, or other applicable formations: Those who
can, Right Arm Turn 1/4 (or 3/4), then all do the parts of a Grand
Mix. Ends in a Tidal Line.
