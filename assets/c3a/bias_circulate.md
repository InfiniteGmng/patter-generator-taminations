# Bias Circulate

From Parallel Waves or other applicable formations:
Leaders [Circulate](../b1/circulate.md), while the Trailers,
instead of doing a normal Circulate to the spot directly in front of them,
go to the spot Once Removed, to the right or left,
from the spot directly in front of them.
Parallel Waves end in Parallel Waves.
Traffic pattern: From R-H Waves Trailers use a R-H Star;
from L-H Waves Trailers use a L-H Star. This call cannot be fractionalized.
