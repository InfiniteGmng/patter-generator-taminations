# &lt;anything> Choice

**Parts:** 2  

From any applicable formation: Do the &lt;anything> call
followed by the two parts of Choice (Center Line Lockit as Others Trade;
Center Line Hinge as Others Step and Fold).
Usually, to make clear that the &lt;anything> call
is to be treated as part of the larger call,
it will be spoken with the suffix "er’s", e.g., "Spin the Topper’s Choice".
