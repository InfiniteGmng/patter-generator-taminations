# Jay <anything>
**CONCEPT**   


From a Generalized 1/4 Tag or other applicable formations: Jay
identifies distorted boxes, each consisting of two dancers from a
center 1x4 (e.g., line or column) and two outside dancers. The
outsides with whom each center dancer should work is most commonly
determined by the facing direction of the center dancers; the facing
direction of the outside dancers does not matter.

Front Jay means that the centers work in a box with the
outsides toward whom they are facing, Back Jay means that they work
with the outsides who are behind them, Left Jay means that they work
with the outsides who are to their left; similarly for Right Jay. If
no direction is specified, the default is Front.

Same Jay means to do the call in the same distorted box as for
the previous call, regardless of the current facing direction of the
centers. Change Jays means that the centers work with the outsides
with whom they were not working for the previous call.

The resulting formation for each box must be either a box, in
which case they end on the same four spots, or a 1x4 perpendicular to
the original center 1x4. In the latter case, the resulting 1x4s are
also distorted, with the halves of each 1x4 that are closest to the
center of the square offset in the same direction that the members of
their group were offset in the original center 1x4, and forming a box
with each other.
