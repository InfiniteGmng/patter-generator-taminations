Note: Other calls in which all the dancers simply move forward
to create a 3/4 Tag formation, even though they are not generally considered tagging calls,
are sometimes combined with Delight/Dilemma in the same way,
e.g. from a 1/4 Tag "Jay Walker’s Delight" or from Parallel Waves "Extender’s Dilemma".
