# Wrap To a <formation>

From Columns; <formation> will be some kind of Diamond,
Galaxy, or Hourglass:


\#1 dancer: 1/2 [Split Circulate](../b1/circulate.md) and Phantom <formation> Circulate 2.  
\#2 dancer: Circulate, 1/2 Split Circulate, and Phantom <formation> Circulate.  
\#3 dancer: Circulate 2 & 1/2.  
\#4 dancer: Circulate 3.  

All adjust as necessary to end in the given formation.

That is, everyone does Column Circulates until they reach the
front of the column, and then they do <formation> Circulates,
for a total of 3 Circulates. When they reach the front of the column,
they are the lead points for Twin Diamonds or an Hourglass, or the
lead centers for a Galaxy or Point-to-Point Diamonds.

This call cannot be fractionalized.
