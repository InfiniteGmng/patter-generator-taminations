# Single Calls

The calls in this section are all variations on other calls
with similar names. In these calls, each dancer performs an action
similar to what two dancers would be doing in the original call. They
are "half size" versions of the original calls, involving half as
many dancers (4 instead of 8, or 2 instead of 4).

Note that there are other calls that have a similar
relationship (for example, "Single Wheel" is the 2-dancer version of Wheel
and Deal), but there are also calls with names beginning with the
word "Single" that do not relate to another call in the same way
(for example, "Single Circle to a Wave"). Refer to the definition of each
individual call to find out its meaning. Also note that the two-word
combination "Single File" has a different meaning.

## Single Checkmate

From a 2x2 formation: Leaders Box Circulate twice and 1/4 In
(as in Box Transfer) as Trailers Box Circulate, 1/4 In, and Box
Circulate. Ends in a 2x2. This call cannot be fractionalized.

## Single Polly Wally

From a General Column of 4: Ends turn 1/4 to put their left
shoulder toward the center of the column, Step Ahead, turn another
1/4 in their initial turning direction, and adjust to end in a 2x2
formation.

Centers turn 1/4 to put their left shoulder toward the center
of the column, Step Ahead, turn 1/4 to put their left shoulder toward
the center, and Step Ahead to become Lead Belles in a 2x2 formation.

the center of the column.

## Single Shakedown

From dancers back-to-back only:
In one smooth motion, Quarter Right, two-person
Counter Rotate, and Roll. This call cannot be fractionalized.

Comment: "Two-person Counter Rotate" is equivalent
to a Mini-Wave Hinge, but does not imply hand contact.
This choice of wording emphasizes the relationship to Shakedown.

From a Couple or Mini-Wave:
In one smooth motion, Partner Half Tag, and turn another quarter
in the same direction as when starting the Partner Half Tag. 
This call cannot be fractionalized.

fractionalized.
