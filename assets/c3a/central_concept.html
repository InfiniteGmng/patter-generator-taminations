<h2>Central &lt;anything&gt;</h2>

<p>Do the Centers’ part of the &lt;anything&gt; call. This concept applies only to calls where
  original Centers remain in the center and do not interact with the Outsides.</p>

  <p>Typical examples include “Central Load the Boat”, “Central Spin the Windmill”, “Central
    Little More”, “Central Stampede”, “Central Team Up”, and “Central Ease Off”.</p>

  </p>


  <p>“Central Cast a Shadow” and “Central Criss Cross the Shadow” are considered proper
  because the original Centers remain Centers, and the Cloverleaf paths do not include
  interacting with Ends.</p>

<p>If the starting setup is a 2x4, then Central &lt;anything&gt; is done either in each Box or in each
  1x4. In most cases, only one of these possibilities will work. For example, “Central Cross
  Ramble” starts with a Cross Fold action and thus requires working in each wave. If Central
  &lt;anything&gt; can be done in either a Box or a 1x4, then it should be done in each Box unless
    the caller specifies otherwise. For example, from Parallel Waves, “Central Detour” is the
    same as Split Counter Rotate, but “Each Wave Central Detour” is the same as Lockit.</p>

<p>In cases such as “Central Counter”, where the Box default may be counterintuitive for the
  dancers, the caller should specify the desired 4-person setup explicitly, using words such as
  “Each Wave Central Counter” or “Each Box Central Counter”.</p>

<p><i>The following section discusses technical details
  about appropriate &lt;anything&gt; calls. This is
  primarily intended to clarify the criteria
  that a caller should use in selecting the &lt;anything&gt; call.</i>
</p>

  <p>It is not proper to apply the Central concept to such calls as Reverse Cut/Flip the Galaxy,
    Expand the Column, and Plan Ahead, because the original Centers do not remain in the
    center.</p>

<p>It is not proper to apply the Central concept to such calls as Scoot and Little, Relay the Top,
  and Transfer the Column; although the Centers of the result are the original Centers, they
  get there by interacting with the Outsides. (It is proper to apply Central to Little, but not to
  Scoot and Little.)
</p>

<p>Most calls used with Central have explicitly defined Centers’ and Ends’ parts, and the
  Centers can do their part in the center without considering the location or facing direction
  of the Ends. There are a few calls, such as Percolate, which can be used from multiple
  starting setups, some of which have the Centers remaining in the center, while others do
  not. In this case, Central applies specifically to the version of the call in which Centers
  remain Centers.
</p>

<p>Example: When Percolate is danced from Facing Lines, Lines Facing Out, or Inverted
  Lines, the original Centers remain Centers. Thus, Central Percolate is proper from Facing
  Couples or Back-to-back Couples, and starts with Split/Box Circulate. The fact that
  Percolate can also be called from Parallel Waves or from an Eight Chain Thru setup is not
  relevant because the original Centers do not remain Centers from those starting setups.</p>

  </p>

<p>Example: When Sets in Motion is danced from Parallel Lines with Ends Facing Out, the
  original Centers remain in the center. Thus, Central Sets in Motion is proper and ends in
  Facing Couples. The fact that Sets in Motion can also be called from Waves or Lines with
  Ends Facing In or in Tandem is not relevant because the Centers do not remain Centers
  from those starting setups.</p>
