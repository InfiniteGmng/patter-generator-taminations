# Release <anything>
**CONCEPT**   


From a Generalized 1/4 Tag or Generalized 1/4 Diamond:
the Ends of the Center 4 [Press Ahead](../c1/press.md)
as the unapproached
Outside dancers [Press Out](../c1/press.md);
Outsides work with Phantoms (if necessary) and all do the <anything> call.

> 

Note: Phantoms are removed at the end of the call to eliminate empty planes
between the Outsides and the Centers, unless the <anything> call
involves a concept which specifically includes phantoms.
For example, Release Triple Wave [Ah So](../c1/ah_so.md) retains the
Phantoms whereas Release Ah So doesn't).
