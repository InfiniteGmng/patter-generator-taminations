# <anything> (Cross) Reaction

The <anything> call is one where the modifier "(Centers) to a
Wave" would result in a 1/4 Tag. The dancers do the <anything>
call to that point, and then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain
Reaction). Conventions for how the <anything> call is
named in this context are explained in the subsections below.

## Scoot (Chain Thru) (Cross) Reaction

From Parallel Ocean Waves: Scoot Back (or Scoot Chain Thru),
Centers to a Wave (i.e., leaving off the final Extend); then do a
full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain Reaction). Note that for a Scoot
Back, the word "Back" is not spoken.

## <tag> (Cross) Reaction

The starting formation depends on the
<tag> action. Do the Scoot Back variation of that tagging
action (i.e. get to the 1/2 Tag position and then Scoot Back) leaving
off the final Extend, then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain
Reaction).

Note that there is an unspoken "Back" (Scoot Back) in this
case, e.g., Tag Reaction means Tag Back Reaction. The center wave
always does the trading action of the Scoot Back before starting the
Chain Reaction.

## <anything> (Cross) Reaction

For any other applicable call, do that call (Centers) to a
Wave, then do a full Chain Reaction (or Cross Chain Reaction). This
is most commonly used at C-3A with calls in the Transfer the Column
family, e.g., Triple Play Cross Reaction. (Note: The specific case of
Open Up the Column Reaction is typically abbreviated as "Open Up
Reaction".)
