# Drift Apart

**Parts:** 2  

From a 2x4 formation: Ends Split Circulate twice while
out-facing Centers Crossover Circulate and then Circulate, and
in-facing Centers Circulate and then Crossover Circulate. Ends in a
2x4. Everyone simply does their part of these actions; they do not
re-evaluate the formation as the call progresses.

From Columns, the "out-facing Centers" and "in-facing Centers"

### Teaching Notes

For dancers in General Lines, this can also be thought of as
Ends Split Circulate twice as Centers Once-Removed Circulate twice.
For dancers in Generalized Columns, this can be thought of as
Ends Split Circulate twice as Centers Magic Circulate twice.
An even simpler formulation from lines,
though it is not faithful to the Roll behavior,
is all (do your part of) Tandem Cross Roll to a Wave/Line.
